He further wrote “I hesitate not to pronounce the \\nGita’s performance of great originality, of sublimity of conception, reasoning and \\ndiction almost unequalled and a single exception amongst all the known religions of \\nmankind”. \\n \\nThe Gita deals with human problems in a human way. That is why it has a \\ntremendous appeal. It has inspired the human mind in India for centuries and today it \\ncasts its spell on millions of people across the various parts of the world. It remains \\nthe most translated work in the Globe. The modern technology like the Internet has \\nfurther increased its reputation by carrying its message to every nook and corner of \\nthe world. A mere click on the word ‘Bhagavad Gita’ in the Google search engine \\nthrows about 963,000 results. An incredible reach for any scripture! \\n \\nAmong the great and extraordinary people who were inspired and found their outlook \\nchanged by the timeless wisdom of the Gita are thinkers, writers, scientists and \\nphilosophers like Mahatma Gandhi, B.G.Tilak, Sri Aurobindo, Albert Einstein, Dr. \\nAlbert Schweitzer, Herman Hesse, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Aldous Huxley, Walt \\nWhitman, Henry David Thoreau, Annie Besant, Robert Oppenheimer Sir Edwin \\nArnold and Carlyle to name but a few. \\n \\nIn India it was left to Adi Sankara who lived in the 8th century A.D. to reveal the \\ngreatness of the Gita to the world. He retrieved it from the mighty tomes of the epic, \\nthe Mahabharata, and wrote a brilliant commentary on it. It is this commentary which \\nprevails as a classic text even today. Later great acharyas like Ramanuja, Madhva, \\nVallabha and others came out with their own commentaries which are popular among \\ntheir followers. In modern times Sant Jnanesvar, B.G.Tilak, Aurobindo contributed \\ntheir original thinking on the text. \\n \\nDespite this enormous popularity, the Bhagavad Gita remains a less understood but a \\nbetter known text; people know more about it than what is it about.

And still others though hearing its teachings do not comprehend \\nits wonderful significance!   \\n \\nBhagavan Sri Krishna also says in the Gita (7.3) “Among thousands of men , one by \\nchance aspires for perfection; even among those successful aspirants only one by \\nchance knows Me in essence.” A question arises why such enlightened persons are so \\nrare in our midst and why such an achievement is not within the reach of everyone.  \\n \\nVedanta being a subjective science rarely one tries to know how to remove one's \\nweaknesses and develop inner strength much less one tries to live up to the ideals \\npropounded by it and bring about consequent re-adjustments in one's life. Very few \\nfeel this urge to evolve themselves and most of us do not even find the need for self \\nimprovement. We grope along by the voice of tradition, authority, herd-instinct and \\ngroup-mentality. Of those who strive to see the truth and reach the goal, only a few \\nsucceed. Of those who gain the sight, not even one learns to live by the sight. \\n \\nNo wonder once a teacher wanting to educate a child about the Gita asked him “Do \\nyou know Gita”? The child replied “Yes, I know, that is the name of my next door \\naunty”.  The child obviously heard of Gita and had his own meaning of it in his mind \\nand remained happy about it. That is the case with most of us today including the \\nlarge mass of modern educated sections. Then where do we go from here? Again, the \\nGita says by constant learning and practice one can certainly improve oneself. Let us \\nattempt to heed that advice through this series of essays. \\n \\nWHAT IS THE GITA? \\n \\nThe dictionary meaning of the word ‘Gita’ is a song or poem containing an inspired \\ndoctrine and the word ‘Bhagavat’ means a blessed or adorable or venerable or divine \\nOne. Hence Srimad Bhagavad Gita is variously called as ‘The Song of God’, ‘The \\nDivine Song’, ‘A Song of Fortune’, ‘The Lord’s Song’, ‘The Holy Song of God’, \\n‘The Song of the Lord’, Gudartha Deepika, Gita Rahasya, Jnaneshwari, \\nBhavaarthadipika, Sadhaka Sanjeevani and so on. The noted English poet, journalist \\nand a Principal of the Government Sanskrit College at Pune, Sir Edwin Arnold (1832-\\n1904) called his famous poetic version of the Bhagavad Gita as ‘The Song Celestial’.  \\nThe Bhagavad Gita’s another title is ‘moksha sastra’ or ‘Scripture of Liberation’. \\nHowever, it is more popularly known as “The Gita”. \\n \\nThe Bhagavad Gita is a sacred Hindu scripture, considered among the most important \\ntexts in the history of literature and philosophy. It finds a place in the Bhishma Parva \\nof the Mahabharata. It comprises of 18 chapters spread out in 700 verses. Its author is \\nVeda Vyasa, the compiler of the Mahabharata who wrote this epic through the hands \\nof the Lord of Wisdom, Sri Ganesha. Its teachings are considered timeless and the \\nexact time of revelation of the scripture is considered of little spiritual significance. \\nThe teacher of the Bhagavad Gita is Lord Krishna, who is revered as a manifestation \\nof God, The Bhagvan, Parabrahman. \\n \\nThe content of the Gita is the conversation between Lord Krishna and Arjuna taking \\nplace on the battlefield of Kurukshetra before the start of the war between the two \\nclans of brothers - the Kauravas and the Pandavas. \\n \\n\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-1.pdf', 'file_path': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-1.pdf', 'page': 4, 'total_pages': 33, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': 'SRIMAD BHAGAVAD GITA', 'author': 'Vijay', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Acrobat PDFMaker 7.0 for Word', 'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 7.0 (Windows)', 'creationDate': \"D:20110525124300+05'30'\", 'modDate': \"D:20110529191200+05'30'\", 'trapped': ''}, page_content=\" \\nResponding to Arjuna's confusion and moral dilemma about fighting his own cousins, \\nBhagavan Krishna explains to Arjuna his duties as a warrior and prince and elaborates \\non different Vedantic concepts.

King Pandu had five sons who were known as Pandavas.  \\nDhritarashtra had one hundred sons who were called as Kauravas, the eldest of whom \\nwas Duryodhana. Bhishma was the uncle of  Pandu and Dhritarashtra. \\n \\nAfter Pandu's death his children, Pandavas, were brought up and educated along with \\nKauravas under the supervision of Bhishma and patronage of Dhritarashtra.  Drona \\nwas a skillful teacher who taught them all the techniques of warfare.  Pandavas were \\nintelligent and brave. Within a short time they could master the art of warfare.  \\nYudhishtira, the eldest of the Pandavas, succeeded his father as the king. \\n \\nDuryodhana was jealous of the Pandavas. When Yudhishtira was proclaimed a king \\nDuryodhana could not keep quiet and watch.  He employed all foul means to destroy \\nPandavas and every time he tried to kill them he met with failure. On Bhishma's \\nadvice the kingdom was divided into two parts - the better one with Hastinapur as \\ncapital was taken by the Kauravas while the Pandavas took the other half and built a \\nnew beautiful capital called Indraprastha for themselves. \\n \\nDhritarashtra was equally affectionate towards his sons and Pandavas but had the \\nweakness to be sympathetic towards his eldest son's sorrows and disappointments.  \\n \\nOnce Duryodhana invited Yudhishtira for a game of dice wherein the former with the \\nhelp of his cunning and deceitful uncle, Sakuni, defeated Yudhishtira by using all \\nfraudulent means.  As a result, Yudhishtira lost not only all his kingdom and \\npossessions but also Draupadi, the wife of all the Pandava brothers.  Draupadi was \\nhumiliated by the Kaurava brothers to such an extent that an attempt was made to \\ndisrobe her in public.  Her honor was saved by Bhagavan Sri Krishna, a great family \\nfriend of the Pandavas. \\n \\nFinally it was settled that Pandavas should live in the forest for twelve years in exile \\nand further one year incognito untraced by any one.

This marvelous advice delivered by The \\nBhagavan in the battlefield at Kurukshetra is the immortal poem, the song divine, the \\nglorious SRIMAD BHAGAVAD GITA which epitomizes the whole gamut of \\nknowledge contained in all the Scriptures. \\n \\nSage Vyasa offered Dhritarashtra the power of sight which would enable him to see \\nthe events of war.  Unwilling to see the inevitable massacre of his sons, the blind king \\ndesired to know the full details of the war. To fulfill Dhritarashtra's request Vyasa \\nbestowed Sanjaya, the trusted minister of Dhritarashtra, with the divine intuitive \\nvision by which he could know not only the incidents of the battlefield but also the \\nideas in the minds of the warriors. \\n \\nAfter ten days of war, Bhishma, the commander of the Kaurava army was severely \\nwounded and thrown off his chariot. When Sanjaya informed Dhritarashtra about this \\nincident the blind king became very sad and asked him to tell him all the details of the \\nwar. The reporting of Sanjaya about the events of war including the dialogue between \\nSri Krishna and Arjuna at the battlefield is contained in the Bhishma Parva of \\nMahabharata wherein The Gita text finds place. The Gita opens with the question of \\nthe blind king to Sanjaya asking him what happened on the battlefield when the two \\narmies faced each other in the battle formation. \\n \\nCENTRAL THEME OF THE GITA \\n \\nThe Bhagvad Gita can be studied from different angles such as a historical document, \\na spiritual treatise, a scriptural text for daily chanting and prayer, a sublime poetry, an \\nexposition of Grammar and meter, or a management manual, depending on one’s own \\noutlook and purpose.  \\n \\nThe objective here is to study it as a spiritual text and try to find out its main theme. \\nOur ancient Rishis have given us a six-point test to determine the main theme of a \\ntext. This is called ‘sadvidvidha tatparya nirnaya linga’. In the light of this six-factor \\ntest let us look at the Gita to discover its central theme. \\n \\nThe 1st point is called upakrama and upasamhara - the beginning and conclusion of a \\ntext. The crux of the subject in the text starts with Arjuna’s confusion, his acceptance \\nof the delusion and surrender to the Lord as a sishya with a request to teach him what \\nis the best for him. The text ends with his statement that all his doubts were cleared, \\nhis delusion is gone and he regained his memory of the Self. This kind of beginning \\nand end of the text shows that the Bhagavad Gita contains the Knowledge that \\nremoves the delusion and bestows the Supreme Good. \\n \\nEven from the teacher’s view point, the text starts from Sri Krishna telling Arjuna that \\nhe is grieving for that which should not be grieved for thereby explaining how sorrow \\nis borne of delusion. It ends by asking Arjuna whether the delusion had gone. This \\nmakes it clear that the entire purpose of the dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna was \\n\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-1.pdf', 'file_path': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-1.pdf', 'page': 7, 'total_pages': 33, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': 'SRIMAD BHAGAVAD GITA', 'author': 'Vijay', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Acrobat PDFMaker 7.0 for Word', 'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 7.0 (Windows)', 'creationDate': \"D:20110525124300+05'30'\", 'modDate': \"D:20110529191200+05'30'\", 'trapped': ''}, page_content=' \\naimed at removing spiritual ignorance which is the cause of delusion. Thus the \\nremoval of sorrow and delusion (soka moha nivritti) is the main theme of the Gita. \\n \\nThe 2nd point is called abhayasa - repetition and emphasis in the text. The 2nd chapter \\ngives ample evidence to this aspect. Krishna frequently tells Arjuna not to grieve and \\nputs forward the reasons for that view from several angles like the true knowledge, \\nduty, ignominy etc. Similarly, the concept of sthitaprajna has been highlighted in \\nseveral ways at various places. This shows imparting Self-Knowledge is the key note \\nin the text. \\n \\nThe 3rd point is called apurvata - the novelty or uniqueness of the theme. Sri Krishna \\ncalls this Self-Knowledge as a secret, guhyam because normal extroverted minds \\ncannot grasp it and hence very few succeed in knowing it. Similarly, moderation in all \\nwalks of our lives has been stressed at many places. The teachings of the Gita are thus \\nunique. \\n \\nThe 4th point is phalam or the fruit or the end result of the study of the text. Removal \\nof sorrow and confusion and attainment of clear thinking and supreme knowledge - \\nenlightenment - are the end result of the study of the text. \\n \\nThe 5th point is arthavada - positive praise of the subject and negative condemnation \\nof the opposite. We find many slokas in the text extolling the supreme Self-\\nKnowledge and condemning spiritual ignorance. Thus attaining the Supreme \\nKnowledge is the goal of the Gita. \\n \\nThe 6th and the last point is upapatti - illustration and reasoning. We find in the text \\nthat Krishna has been giving a lot of logical explanations and reasoning to convince \\nArjuna about his teachings. He uses profusely the word ‘tasmat’ meaning ‘therefore’. \\nHis arguments are given from many standpoints, the main goal of all His efforts being \\nelimination of sorrow and delusion through Self-Knowledge. The nature of Self is \\nalso revealed through examples and reasoning. These indicate the Supreme \\nknowledge ( tattva jnanam) as the main subject matter of the Gita. \\n \\nTherefore Self-Knowledge (atma jnana) which eliminates our ignorance and the \\nconsequent problems created and bestows the ultimate good for all of us (shreyas) is \\nthe core theme of the Gita. \\n \\nOVER-VIEW OF THE GITA \\n \\nThe entire Bhagavad Gita can be divided into five topics viz.  \\n \\n1.

The solution to them \\ncan be short term which will only be of temporary nature or long term which will be \\nof permanent nature. The Gita offers a long term solution with which anybody can \\nface any situation in life at any time anywhere. This spiritual solution teaches us to \\nlook at life as a whole and live a whole life.  Finding a solution is just not enough. We \\nmust know how to implement it. The Gita provides us with a practical guidance that \\nhelps us to understand how to live according to the guidelines offered. \\n \\nBut living a life according to the guidelines offered is also not adequate unless it is \\nspiced with certain basic vision and values. If a person’s vision of life is limited to \\nmundane happiness derived from the senses, he will merely spend his life time in \\neating, drinking and making merry. His value system will revolve round making \\nmoney by any means to satisfy his never ending needs. But the value system of a \\nperson with a philanthropic bent or an animal lover or an environmentalist or \\nspiritually oriented will be entirely different. The Gita provides us with such an \\nenlarged vision of life laying the foundation for a sense of fulfillment. \\n \\nFinally, the Gita gives us the vision of a person who has gained the supreme \\nKnowledge and lives anchored in it. One who faces problems and crisis in life gains \\nthe vision of Truth, puts it into practice, and lives according to that value system. He \\nbecomes a jivan mukta, liberated in this very life. He is called a sthita prajna and the \\nGita gives us a vivid description of his nature. \\n \\nSuch an analytical understanding of the various topics in the Bhagavad Gita makes it \\neasy for us to study it fruitfully and gives us a ready reference point to check out the \\nslokas (verses) according to our requirement. \\n \\nMAIN CONCEPTS OF THE GITA \\n \\nThe main philosophical subject matter of the Bhagavad Gita is the explanation of five \\nbasic concepts.  \\n \\n¾ Jiva, the individual soul or the living being \\n¾ Jagat, the universe he lives in or nature or matter   \\n¾ Jagadishvara, the creator of the universe or the Supreme Controller and the \\nrelationship between Jiva, Jagat and Jagadishvara. \\n¾ Dharma (Duty in accordance with Divine law)  \\n¾ Kaala (Time)  \\n \\nKrishna counsels Arjuna on the greater idea of dharma, or universal harmony and \\nduty. He begins with the tenet that the soul (Atman) is eternal and immortal. Any \\n'death' on the battlefield would involve only the shedding of the body, whereas the \\nsoul is permanent.  \\n \\nIn order to clarify his point, Krishna expounds the various Yoga processes and \\nunderstanding of the true nature of the universe. He describes the yogic paths of \\ndevotional service -Bhakti Yoga, action - Karma Yoga, meditation - Dhyana Yoga or \\nRaja Yoga and knowledge - Jnana Yoga. \\n\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-1.pdf', 'file_path': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-1.pdf', 'page': 9, 'total_pages': 33, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': 'SRIMAD BHAGAVAD GITA', 'author': 'Vijay', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Acrobat PDFMaker 7.0 for Word', 'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 7.0 (Windows)', 'creationDate': \"D:20110525124300+05'30'\", 'modDate': \"D:20110529191200+05'30'\", 'trapped': ''}, page_content=' \\nFundamentally, the Bhagavad Gita proposes that true enlightenment comes from \\ngoing beyond identification with the temporal ego, the \\'False Self\\', the ephemeral \\nworld, so that one identifies with the truth of the immortal self, the absolute soul or \\nAtman.  \\n \\nThrough detachment from the material sense of ego, the Yogi, or follower of a \\nparticular path of Yoga, is able to transcend his/her illusory mortality and attachment \\nto the material world and enters the realm of the Supreme. \\n \\nKrishna does not propose that the physical world must be abandoned or neglected.  \\nRather, one\\'s life on Earth must be lived in accordance with greater laws and truths; \\none must embrace one\\'s temporal duties whilst remaining mindful of timeless reality, \\nacting for the sake of service without consideration for the results thereof. Such a life \\nwould naturally lead towards stability, happiness and, ultimately, enlightenment. \\n \\nIn the Bhagavad Gita Krishna refers to the war about to take place as ‘Dharma \\nYuddha’, meaning a righteous war for the purpose of justice.  He also states that he \\nincarnates in each age (yuga) to establish righteousness in the world. \\n \\nWHY STUDY THE GITA? \\n \\nSrimad Bhagavad Gita has been a source of inspiration and enlightenment for \\ngenerations. The message of the Gita is not merely a general spiritual philosophy or \\nethical doctrine but it has a bearing upon the practical aspects in the application of \\nsuch principles in our day-to-day lives. It is indeed \"An Users\\' Manual for the Practice \\nof the Art of Right Living\". \\n \\nThe centuries old Bhagavad Gita continues to be the most relevant beacon light for all \\nof us today. The modern man, like Arjuna, is at the crossroads where the focus is \\nmore on improving the Standard of Living rather than the Standard of Life, more on \\nthe Stock Exchange Index than on the Human Development Quotient, more on the \\nCost of Living than on the Quality of Life. This has resulted in his disorientation and \\nimbalance in an environment of shifting values. While science aims to enhance the \\ncomfort of human life, spirituality teaches us how to be comfortable with what we \\nhave. That is the difference. In this scenario, the Gita is the only source of strength for \\nthe development of an integrated personality, a complete man, within us. \\n  \\nThe Gita teaches how to achieve harmony with divinity in the midst of disharmony by \\nsubduing all outward energies and remaining in equanimity with pairs of opposites \\nlike pain and pleasure, aversion and attraction, success and failure etc. The focus of \\nthe Gita is moderation and its aim is the total surrender of man before the Supreme \\nwhile continuing to perform his duties in the spirit of Yoga.   \\n \\nThe problem that is facing us today is that while the world is coming closer physically \\nit is drifting apart mentally and emotionally. Hence all the conflicts and violence, \\ndestruction and damage across the globe. The urgent need, therefore, is the \\nreconciliation and reconditioning of the human mindset, to inculcate a global vision \\nand bring about the universal brotherhood.  \\n \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-1.pdf', 'file_path': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-1.pdf', 'page': 10, 'total_pages': 33, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': 'SRIMAD BHAGAVAD GITA', 'author': 'Vijay', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Acrobat PDFMaker 7.0 for Word', 'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 7.0 (Windows)', 'creationDate': \"D:20110525124300+05'30'\", 'modDate': \"D:20110529191200+05'30'\", 'trapped': ''}, page_content=' \\nThe Gita is specially suited for the purpose, as it attempts to bring together varied and \\napparently antithetical forms of the consciousness and emphasizes the root \\nconceptions of humanity which are neither ancient nor modern, belonging neither to \\nthe east nor the west, but eternal and universal.  \\n \\nIts beauty and sublimity lie in its everlasting relevance to the daily problems of human \\nlife, either occidental or oriental.

We do not know \\nwho composed them. It is a set of 9 verses recited as invocation, dedication and \\nprayer to the Gita Knowledge and its glory. For our purposes let us take up one of the \\nverses and understand its meaning.  \\n \\nPrapanna paarijaataaya totra vetraika paanaye | \\nJnaanamudraaya krishnaaya geetaamrita duhe namah || \\n \\nSalutations to Bhagvan Krishna, with His right hand in Jnana Mudra, the bestower of \\nall needs to those who surrender to Him completely, the milker of the divine nectar of \\nthe Bhagavad Gita, the holder of the whip in one hand for driving the cows. \\n \\nThis verse describes Sri Krishna with His right hand held in Jnana Mudra - in \\nknowledge posture - wherein the thumb is joined to the forefinger and all the other \\nthree fingers are stretched out, the gesture symbolizing knowledge. This is a \\nremarkable concept in Indian Vedantic philosophy and spirituality which indicates \\nthat our body postures have psychological counter parts. As the mind is, so is the \\nbody; bodily expressions being the manifestation of the working of the mind or the \\neffect of psyche. This is what we call ‘body language’ in the modern business school \\nterminology. It means that there is nothing in this world so purifying as Knowledge.  \\n \\nWe offer our obeisance to Sri Krishna who is the embodiment of Knowledge and who \\nimparts such knowledge to all those who seek it from Him. This is what Arjuna does \\nin the Gita. That knowledge is the Supreme Knowledge - the knowledge of the \\nAbsolute Reality, the knowledge of Dharma, the knowledge of righteousness, the \\nknowledge about the right way of living.  \\n \\nWith this prayer let us start our journey in the Gita Ganga and crave for Sri Krishna’s \\nenlightenment. \\n \\nPREAMBLE \\n \\nThe 1st Chapter in the Gita introduces the scene, the setting, the circumstances and the \\ncharacters involved determining the reasons for the espousal of the Bhagavad Gita. \\nThe scene is the sacred plain of Kurukshetra. The setting is a battlefield. The situation \\nis that the war between the two clans of brothers, the Kauravas and the Pandavas is \\nabout to begin.   \\n \\nThe main characters are Bhagavan Sri Krishna and the valiant Arjuna from the side of \\nPandavas and Duryodhana from the side of Kauravas in the midst of large armies on \\nboth the sides led by their respective commanders.  \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-1.pdf', 'file_path': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-1.pdf', 'page': 12, 'total_pages': 33, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': 'SRIMAD BHAGAVAD GITA', 'author': 'Vijay', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Acrobat PDFMaker 7.0 for Word', 'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 7.0 (Windows)', 'creationDate': \"D:20110525124300+05'30'\", 'modDate': \"D:20110529191200+05'30'\", 'trapped': ''}, page_content=\" \\nAfter noticing the principal warriors on both the sides, Arjuna falls into the mood of \\ndeep dejection and melancholy due to the fear of destruction of friends and relatives \\nin the course of the impending war leading to his resolve not to take up arms against \\nhis kith and kin.

All the \\nremaining verses are Sanjaya`s report to him about the happenings at the battlefield of \\nKurukshetra just before the war. \\n \\nThe battlefield is called dharmakshetra or the sacred field because The Lord who is \\nthe protector and embodiment of Dharma was actively present in it. Kurukshetra \\nmeans the field of the Kurus, a leading clan of that era. This question of Dhritarashtra \\nexhibits a sense of anxiety in him on two counts. If Pandavas decide not to undertake \\nthe war, his sons will automatically get the kingdom and in such an event, the stigma \\nof waging the unrighteous war might not stick to his covetous and deceitful sons.  If \\nhis sons decide not to wage the war they will lose the kingdom that was earlier \\nacquired by them through deceit, because of which they will be as good as dead. Such \\nwas the anxiety in the king’s mind because of the greatness and spiritual atmosphere \\nof the field of battle. \\n \\nMamakaah : My people.  And ‘Pandu’s sons’. - This sort of divisive reference to one \\nand the same family members indicates the absence of the sense of familiarity and \\ncloseness with regard to the Pandavas and thereby betrays hostility towards them. \\n \\nThis sense of a pair of opposites ‘mine-ness’ and ‘not mine-ness’ is the result of \\nahamkara or `I - ness' which is the source of all evil. The conflict between the two \\ncousin groups represents the clash between two sets of values of life - one standing \\nfor virtue, justice and righteousness staking a legitimate claim for the kingdom lost \\nthrough deceit and treachery and the other for vice, injustice, greed, hunger for power \\nand the foul means  employed to justify the ends. It indirectly indicates that life itself \\nis a battle between good and evil. \\n \\nTWO ARMIES \\n \\nsanjaya uvaacha \\ndrishtwaa tu paandavaaneekam vyoodham duryodhanastadaa \\naachaaryam upasamgamya raajaa vachanam abraveet  // 1.2 // \\n\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-1.pdf', 'file_path': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-1.pdf', 'page': 13, 'total_pages': 33, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': 'SRIMAD BHAGAVAD GITA', 'author': 'Vijay', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Acrobat PDFMaker 7.0 for Word', 'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 7.0 (Windows)', 'creationDate': \"D:20110525124300+05'30'\", 'modDate': \"D:20110529191200+05'30'\", 'trapped': ''}, page_content=' \\nSanjaya said \\nHaving seen the army of Pandavas drawn up in battle array, King Duryodhana then \\napproached his teacher, Drona, and spoke these words. \\n \\nDuryodhana was thinking all along that it might not be possible for the Pandavas to \\nmobilize forces strong enough to face his own huge army.

We shall now have a critical look \\nat it. As we take up our seats in the comfortable opera house at Kurukshetra, the \\npanorama unfolding before us on the stage is the gigantic field of the battle between \\nthe Kauravas and the Pandavas. While the text mentions the names of a number of \\ncharacters about to play their roles on both the sides, we are concerned with only three \\nof them for our critical evaluation. They are 1. King Dhritarashtra 2. The valiant \\nArjuna and 3. Bhagavan Sri Krishna, who assumed the role of a charioteer to Arjuna.  \\n \\nIf we analyze their mindsets we automatically understand the concepts and issues \\ninvolved and their complexity. The immortal appeal of the Gita lies in the guided tour \\nthe Jagad Guru, Sri Krishna, takes us through the annoying wide-spread pot-holes of \\nignorance (lack of right knowledge, avidya in Sanskrit) on the road and who \\nultimately makes it possible for us to reach the destination of enlightenment, free from \\nthe shackles of bondage. This journey from darkness to light is definitely exasperating \\nat times but yet manageable. \\n \\nDHRITARASHTRA \\n \\nDhritarashtra already heard several reasons for the likely victory of the Pandavas. He \\nwas afraid of the possibility of loss of kingdom for his own sons, the Kauravas. He \\ntherefore asks Sanjaya “what did my sons, Duryodhana and others, as well as Pandu’s \\nsons, Yudhishthira and others, actually do on the battlefield at Kurukshetra? Did they \\nundertake the war according to their earlier plan for fighting or did they act otherwise \\nor do something else as a result of sagging of the will to fight due to some reason?  \\n \\nApart from the inbuilt fear complex in the mind of Dhritarashtra, a significant aspect \\nof his question is his making a distinction between his own sons and the sons of \\nPandu. Although the question in the form ‘What did my sons do?’ would have been \\nsufficient, he, by separately mentioning his sons and Pandu’s sons exhibits an absence \\nof family homogeneity and harmony in his mind. \\n \\nThe image of the King here is that he is not only physically blind but also is deprived \\nof the vision of personal kindness and a human touch and inclusiveness.

All \\nthe rest of the seven hundred stanzas are Sanjaya's report on what happened on the \\nKurukshetra battlefield, just before the war.  \\n \\nThe old king is certainly conscious of the palpable injustices that he had done to his \\nnephews, the Pandavas. Dhritarashtra knew the relative strength of the two armies, \\nand therefore, was fully confident of the larger strength of his son's army. And yet, the \\nviciousness of his past and the consciousness of the crimes perpetrated seem to be \\nweighing heavily upon his heart, and so he has his own misgivings on the final \\noutcome.  \\n \\nDhritarashtra is physically blind. But passion and desire do not disappear with the \\nabsence of sight. Even if all the sense organs were lost, the desires hidden within the \\nmind would not vanish and so his mind is curious, eager and troubled to know what is \\nhappening on the battlefield. \\n \\nARJUNA \\n \\nArjuna is intelligent and where there is intelligence there is doubt and where there is \\ndoubt there is dilemma. Arjuna is rational and where there is rationality, there lies the \\ncapacity to think from a totally different perspective. Where one has these qualities, it \\nis difficult to enter into a dangerous situation like war with closed eyes. \\n \\nRemember that life does not end the same way as it begins; the end is always \\nunknown and invisible. In this war Duryodhana’s focus was entirely on Bheema. He \\noverlooked the fact that Krishna was on the side of Pandavas and particularly as the \\ncharioteer of Arjuna. He could not visualize that Krishna would retrieve Arjuna from \\nhis shortcomings and consequently the whole story took a different turn and \\nDuryodhana lost. \\n \\nArjuna requested Krishna to place his chariot between the two armies so that he can \\nobserve with whom he has to fight. The points to be noted here are: \\n \\nOnce observation starts, analysis is not far too behind and analysis always leads to \\nwavering of mind. So Arjuna analyses the question to fight or not to fight and comes \\nto the conclusion that he should not fight. In all his arguments in support of that \\nconclusion he puts forward several pleadings which apparently look valid and very \\nwise but in fact are very hollow as Krishna proves them to be subsequently. \\n \\nAt this stage although it looks that Arjuna is not obsessed with war, he is not against \\nwar either and has no aversion to violence. All his life he fought many wars and his \\nwhole life’s education and training and his lifelong conditioning is all violence and \\nwar. Then why he turns his face against war? We have to understand this paradoxical \\nsituation very clearly because this is the very seed for all the teachings contained in \\nthe Bhagavad Gita.

He suddenly started exhibiting \\nseveral symptoms of weakness both physically and psychologically. He was afflicted \\nwith great depression of mind masquerading as compassion. Arjuna himself described \\nhis physical symptoms in graphic terms. It was of the nature of a Fever of Unknown \\nOrigin (F.U.O.) or a Bhava-roga in Sanskrit. This disease is the oldest known to \\nhuman kind. Its origin is traced to ajnana or avidya or ignorance in the Vedanta of \\nHinduism. The divine potion or elixir (amrita) that cures this disease is Jnana or \\nKnowledge, grace of God, issuing from self-surrender, prayer and freedom from \\ndesire (bhakti, sharnagati, prapatti, nirvasana) and so on. \\n \\nWhat makes the Gita, a unique medicine of bhava-roga is that it contains all the \\ningredients stated above, fit to be consumed by peoples of all ages, climes, genders - \\nmonastic or lay. The Arjuna syndrome, analyzed and diagnosed by the master \\nphysician Sri Krishna is the starting point of the preparation of this unique brew. \\n \\nAdi Shankaracharya’s description of the Arjuna syndrome is simple and remarkable. \\nIt is not that Arjuna was unwilling to do his duty as the Army General when he came \\nfor war. Arjuna is a picture of courage and self-confidence before the war. In the \\nverses 21 and 22 of the 1st chapter he roars like an impatient lion waiting to pounce on \\nits prey. \\n \\nAfterwards, Arjuna’s mood suddenly changes. At what point of time and for what \\nreasons did he become a victim of the Arjuna syndrome? \\n \\nVerses 28-46 of the 1st Chapter, if properly analyzed word for word, give us the clue. \\nArjuna saw in the huge armies his own people, (svajana)-fathers, grandfathers, \\nbrothers, teachers, friends etc., and was overcome with pity. The key word here is \\nsvajana, people who are one’s very own. It may be noted that Arjuna uses the word \\n‘svajana’ four times in these verses. Arjuna’s lament and depression are rooted in this \\nfeeling of svajanatva - one’s own-ness.

In fact, Krishna’s great sermon was preached on the battlefield! \\n \\nHow hard it is to arrive at this sort of non-attachment? Therefore Krishna shows us \\nthe lower ways and methods. The easiest way for every one is to do his or her work \\nand not take the results. It is our desire that binds us. If we take the results of actions, \\nwhether good or evil, we will have to bear them. But if we work not for ourselves, but \\nall for the glory of the Lord, the results will take care of themselves. To work you \\nhave the right, but not to the fruits thereof. The soldier works for no results. He does \\nhis duty. If defeat comes, it belongs to the General and not to the soldier. We do our \\nduty for love’s sake-love for the General, love for the Lord”. \\n \\nWith such a kind of the Charioteer guiding the eminent soldier Arjuna, let us see what \\nstrategy Krishna adopted in the very first scene of the Gita to achieve the purpose of \\nhis avatar, his descent from the Vaikuntha.  \\n \\nWhen Arjuna asked Krishna to place his chariot between the two armies, Krishna \\nplaced it with his sagacity, at such a point from where his kinsmen such as Bhishma, \\nteachers like Drona and other chief kings and warriors of the Kaurava army, could be \\nclearly seen. After keeping the chariot at a crucial spot he told Arjuna, “O Partha (the \\nson of Prtha, Kunti, and Krishna’s aunt) behold all these Kurus, assembled here”. This \\nstatement has got a deep significance. \\n \\nIn the word ‘Kuru’, the sons of both Dhritarashtra and Pandu are included because of \\nboth of them belong to the Kuru lineage.. Krishna by saying ‘behold all these Kurus \\nassembled here’ means that they are all one, whether they are on his side or opposite \\nside and whether they are good or bad and thus a feeling of kinship may develop in \\nArjuna.  This feeling of kinship may lead to attachment and make him inquisitive. \\nThus, by making Arjuna an instrument, Krishna wants to preach the gospel of the Gita \\nfor the humanity as a whole. Therefore, Krishna instead of using the word \\n‘Dhartarashtran’ used the word ‘Kurun’. Had he used the former word, Arjuna would \\nhave become enthusiastic (as could be observed from Arjuna’s dialogues using this \\nword) and there would not have been any chance to expound the Gita. \\n  \\nKrishna considered his duty to destroy Arjuna’s delusion by first arousing it and then \\ndestroying it as in the case of certain medical procedures for achieving his avowed \\npurpose of establishing and protecting Dharma in the world through his several \\nincarnations. \\n \\nThe relationship between Arjuna and Krishna in this scene is that of a car owner and \\nhis driver. The driver just drives the car to the place where its owner wants him to go. \\nThe driver does not question the owner or pass any comments on the owner’s \\ninstructions or wish. But here Krishna tells or directs Arjuna “Behold these Kurus”. \\nThere is no need for these remarks as Arjuna will see the assembled warriors anyway \\nand Krishna could have placed the chariot without uttering any words. But he \\nintentionally used the words ‘Kurun Pasya’ to arouse attachment in Arjuna. \\n \\nThe main reason of Arjuna’s grief is that when Krishna placed the chariot between the \\ntwo armies and asked Arjuna to behold the Kauravas, he saw his relatives, teachers \\nand friends etc. and thus his sense of attachment was aroused.

Thus we see that it is delusion which changes a hero’s great courage \\ninto anxiety and worry state neurosis. \\n \\nDr.S.Radhakrishnan says that Arjuna’s cry or demand was simple yet tremendous and \\ndamaging one, “significant of the tragedy of man, which all, who can see beyond the \\nactual drama of the hour, can recognize. The mood of despair in which Arjuna is \\nfound in the 1st Chapter of the Gita is what the mystics call the dark night of the soul, \\nan essential step in the upward path. Krishna stands for the voice of God, delivering \\nthe message in the thrilling notes, warning Arjuna against dejection of spirit. As the \\ndialogue proceeds, the dramatic element disappears. The echoes of the battlefield die \\naway and we have only an interview between God and man”. \\n \\nLive as the Gita teaches you to Live \\n \\nThe core teaching of Krishna in the Gita is that where there is virtue there is the \\nprospect of victory and glorious life, both in this world and hereafter and wherever \\nthere are vice, unrighteousness, injustice and immorality, there is destruction, \\nphysical, moral and spiritual. \\n \\nThe senses of ‘I’, ‘Me’, and ‘Mine’ are the root of all evils and bondages in the world \\nand the senses of ‘you’ and ‘your’ bring freedom to the soul. A wise man is the one \\nwho goes beyond the sense of ‘I’, and knows the secret of ‘you’ by which he gets rid \\nof the senses of ‘I’ and ‘Mine’. As long as we remain selfish we are caught in the net \\nof desires and the world, so long we shall not be able to realize the real essence of the \\nGita. So Krishna says detachment is freedom and attachment is bondage. Therefore he \\ninstructs everybody to perform work disinterestedly without asking for results thereof \\nbecause desire for the result of works is the chain that binds men and drags them into \\nthe den of delusion or maya.  \\n \\nKrishna represents the realized soul free of all conditioning, capable of seeing the \\ntruth as it is. He is the Self in a state of sat-chit-ananda. Arjuna is consciousness \\ncrumpled by conditioning. The chariot he rides is the body. The horses are the senses. \\nThe two wheels are the desire and destiny. As a charioteer, Krishna does two things - \\n1. He helps Arjuna to realize the true nature of life and 2. He overpowers the forces \\nthat threaten social order.  \\n \\nHe classifies all actions into two viz. reaction and response; the former is guided by \\none’s ego, motivated by one’s desires and the latter is guided by one’s intellect \\nmotivated by one’s duty. The former focuses on result while the latter focuses on \\naction. Krishna proves that by responding rather than by reacting, by maintaining \\nequanimity and not getting provoked by worldly stimuli, it is possible to satisfy the \\ndemands of worldliness, fulfill one’s obligation to the society, repay one’s debts to \\nancestors and still attain moksha, liberation.  \\n \\nThe varnashrama dharma categorizes life into four stages to be lived sequentially \\nviz., brahmacharya, grihasta, vanaparstha and sanyasa.

Is the Gita a scripture that propagates war? \\n \\nThe answer is that it is concerned neither with violence nor with non-violence. It \\nneither condones nor condemns war. The point it makes is to look at the root of any \\naction. What is the yardstick that makes one war noble and the other ignoble? It is the \\nmotivation behind it - is it the ego or the common welfare based on justice that \\ndistinguishes the two.  \\n \\nBefore the battle of Kurukshetra begins, Arjuna asks Krishna to drive their chariot \\ninto the open space between the two armies, so that he may see the men he must fight \\nwith. When Krishna does this, Arjuna recognizes many of his kinsmen and old friends \\namong the ranks of the enemy. He is appalled by the realization that he is about to kill \\nthose whom he loves better than life itself. In his despair, he exclaims: ‘I will not \\nfight!’ \\n \\nKrishna’s reply to Arjuna occupies the rest of the book. It deals not only with \\nArjuna’s immediate personal problem, but with the whole nature of action, the \\nmeaning of life, and the aims for which man must struggle here on earth. At the end \\nof their conversation, Arjuna has changed his mind. He is ready to fight. And the \\nbattle begins to fight the evil on the clear understanding that non-resistance to evil is \\nas good as committing evil. \\n \\nTo understand the Gita, we must first consider what it is and what it is not. We must \\nconsider its setting. Krishna and Arjuna are on a battlefield. Arjuna is not a dedicated \\nmonk but a householder and a warrior by birth and profession. His problem is \\nconsidered in relation to the circumstances of the moment. \\n \\nIn the background of Gita is a war, between two families, ready to start. Arjuna the \\nmain hero on one side looks at the family members, elders and friends on the other \\nside and experiences a strong sense of frustration for infighting in the family. \\nAlthough he was a great warrior, he merely broke-down by thinking on the utter \\nfutility of this war and in that moment of depression he asks his mentor about what he \\nshould do.  \\n \\nThe answer given by Shri Krishna is equally unexpected. He says “your present \\nreluctance to fight is illusion. Your problem is not regarding the fight as such but the \\nfight against what you call my relatives, my brothers, my friends”. Krishna says that \\n“your real fight has to be against ‘I' and 'My’ rather than the fight outside”. It is in this \\ncontext of how to come out of our ego i.e. ‘ I ‘ and the result of the ego ‘My' that all \\nthe other seventeen chapters have been strung into one garland.. \\n \\nIn teaching Arjuna, Krishna employs two sets of values, the relative and the absolute. \\nHe begins by dealing with Arjuna’s feelings of revulsion, on general grounds. Arjuna \\nshrinks from the act of killing. Krishna reminds him that, in the absolute sense, there \\nis no such act called killing. The Atman, the indwelling Godhead (soul) is the only \\nreality. This body is simply an appearance; its existence, its destruction, is likewise, \\nillusory. \\n \\n\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-1.pdf', 'file_path': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-1.pdf', 'page': 30, 'total_pages': 33, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': 'SRIMAD BHAGAVAD GITA', 'author': 'Vijay', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Acrobat PDFMaker 7.0 for Word', 'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 7.0 (Windows)', 'creationDate': \"D:20110525124300+05'30'\", 'modDate': \"D:20110529191200+05'30'\", 'trapped': ''}, page_content=' \\nHaving said this, Krishna goes on to discuss Arjuna’s individual problem. For Arjuna, \\na member of the warrior caste, the fighting of this battle is undoubtedly ‘righteous’. \\nHis cause is just. To defend it is his duty. Running away from the battle is avoiding \\nduty and escapism. \\n \\nSocially the caste system is graded, but spiritually, there are no such distinctions. \\nEveryone, says Krishna, can attain the highest sainthood by following the prescribed \\npath of his own caste duty. There have been instances of men everywhere who grew \\ninto spiritual giants while carrying out their duties as merchants, peasants, doctors, \\npriests, or kings. \\n \\nIn the purely physical sphere of action, Arjuna is, indeed, no longer a free agent. The \\nact of war is upon him; it has evolved out of his previous actions. It is his svadharma. \\nAt any given moment in time, we are what we are; and we have to accept the \\nconsequences of being ourselves. Only through this acceptance can we begin to \\nevolve further. We may select the battleground. We cannot avoid the battle. \\n \\nArjuna is bound to act, but he is still free to make his choice between two different \\nways of performing that action. In general, mankind almost always acts with \\nattachment; that is to say, with desire and fear. Desire for a certain result and fear that \\nthis result will not be obtained. Actions with attachments bind us to the world of \\nappearances; to the continual doing of more actions.  \\n \\nBut there is another way of performing action, and this is without desire and without \\nfear. The doer of the non-attached actions is the most conscientious of men. Freed \\nfrom desire and fear, he offers everything he does as a sacrament of devotion to his \\nduty (surrenders all his actions to the Lord). All work becomes equally and vitally \\nimportant. It is only toward the results of work- success or failure, praise or blame- \\nthat he remains indifferent. When action is done in this spirit, Krishna teaches, it will \\nlead to the knowledge of what is behind action, behind all life; the ultimate Reality. \\nAnd, with the growth of this knowledge, the need for further action will gradually fall \\naway from us. We shall realize our true nature, which is God, sat-chit-ananda. \\n \\nIt follows, therefore, that every action, under certain circumstances and for certain \\npeople, may be a stepping-stone to spiritual growth – if it is done in the spirit of non-\\nattachment. All good and all evil is relative to the individual point of growth. For each \\nindividual, certain acts are absolutely wrong. Indeed, there may well be acts that are \\nabsolutely wrong for every individual alive on earth today. But, in the highest sense, \\nthere can be neither good nor evil. Krishna, therefore speaking as God Himself, \\nadvises Arjuna to fight. The Gita thus neither sanctions war nor condemns it. \\nRegarding no action as of absolute value, either for good or for evil, it cannot possibly \\ndo either. (Swami Prabhavananda). \\n \\nDharma and satya were at stake in Kurukshetra. So, preventing adharma from \\ngaining victory over dharma was the purpose of Mahabharata war and fighting for \\ndharma against adharma is the message of Gita. \\n \\nHowever, we have forgotten this message of Gita and have distorted it in the name of \\nahimsa as our dharma unconditionally.

What seems to us a long dialogue must have taken place in the blink of an \\neye on the battlefield!

These instances might be a pre-cursor to \\nthe modern developments in the field of information technology. \\n \\n3. This chapter is entitled “Arjuna Vishaada Yogah: The Yoga of Arjuna’s \\ndespondency”. How despondency or grief can be yoga? \\n \\nThe word Yoga means to join. Any conscious attempt on the part of an individual to \\nlift his present personality and attune it to a higher, perfect ideal is called Yoga.  The \\ntitle of this chapter is self-contradictory. It is named as the Vishaada Yoga or Yoga of \\nArjuna's grief, depression.   If 'grief' could be Yoga, everybody on the earth would be \\nYogins. It cannot be so for obvious reasons. \\n \\nArjuna’s condition of utter despair is the most appropriate mental attitude wherein the \\nseeds of the Gita can be ideally sown for their glorious flowering. The scriptural texts \\nby themselves cannot help any one unless the seeker’s mental condition is prepared to \\nabsorb their teachings. Therefore, even the initial mental condition of Arjuna is called \\nas Yoga as this darkness of the soul is an essential step in the progress to spiritual life.  \\n \\n“Most of us go through life without facing the ultimate questions. It is in rare crises, \\nwhen our ambitions lie in ruins at our feet, when we realize in remorse and agony the \\nsad mess we have made of our lives, we cry out “Why we are here? What does all this \\nmean? Where do we go from here? My God, why have you forsaken me?” Draupadi \\ncries “I have no husbands, no sons, no kinsmen, no brothers, and no father, not even \\nYou, O Krishna”.  Arjuna passes through great spiritual tension. When he detaches \\nfrom his social obligations and asks why he should carry out the duty expected of him \\nby society, he gets behind his socialized self and has full awareness of himself as an \\nindividual alone and isolated. He faces the world as a stranger thrown into a \\nthreatening chaos. The new freedom creates a deep feeling of anxiety, aloneness, \\ndoubt and insecurity. If he is to function successfully, these feelings must be \\novercome”. - Dr. S.

Why in the courts of law in India does one take the oath by putting one’s hand on \\nthe Gita and not on the other scriptures like the Ramayana? \\n \\nThe main reason for this practice is that the avatar of Krishna is considered as \\nPurnavatar i.e. a complete and perfect incarnation.  Krishna is multi-dimensional, \\ntouching all aspects of human personality while Rama is a maryada purushottam. The \\ndictionary meanings of the word maryada are mark, landmark, boundary, limit, end, \\ngoal, strictly defined relation, bounds of morality, moral law. Thus maryada \\npurushottam implies a uni-dimensional nature possessing one note and hence its \\nappeal is bound by the limits of such nature while Krishna’s appeal is universal. A \\nthief, a dancer, a Gopika, a cow-herd, a warrior, an enemy, a rakshasa and of course a \\njnani, a saint uniformly are crazy about him from their own points of view. \\n \\nKrishna is like an orchestra where many instruments are simultaneously played and \\neach one is bound to fall in love with the note emanating from the instrument he likes. \\nThat is the reason why all people like some part of Krishna and nobody knows the \\nwhole of Him as the Gita itself says. To put it in terms of music performances, Rama \\ntattva is like a solo performance while Krishna tattva is like a jugalbandi with a bout \\nof sawal-jawab. \\n \\nGenerally only disputants go to the courts of Law. If anybody really swears by or \\nbelieves in Rama he would never go there. For him courts are redundant. But a person \\ncoming before a court can love Krishna because Krishna is accessible even to the \\nsinners and opens the doors for criminals also as the Gita puts it. Therefore it is the \\npractice to use the Gita text for the purpose of taking oath. However, opinions on this \\npoint may differ. \\n \\nPoints to Ponder  \\n \\n1.

Krishna responds by \\ndetailing His (Brahman’s) manifested expressions analytically and tells how Brahman \\npermeates the whole universe (Verses 20 to 39). Reiterating the fact that the range of His \\ndivine manifestations is infinite, He winds up this topic by pointing out to Arjuna that the \\nentire universe is an insignificant, minuscule fraction of Him (Brahman). \\n \\nThis is Yoga because by meditating over the glories of The Lord as described in this \\nChapter one can discover the Infinite in the finite world of pluralities. The Self \\nconditioned by or functioning through the individual mind and intellect is the Ego (Jiva), \\nlimited by its imperfections. While the same Eternal Self conditioned by or functioning \\nthrough the total (cosmic) mind and intellect is the God-principle or Ishwara unlimited by \\nany imperfections. This concept of the Self as seen through an individual mind and the \\ncosmic mind is explained in this and the next Chapters. \\n \\nThe Text  \\n \\nTHE IMMANENCE AND TRANSCENDENCE OF GOD \\n \\n \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-10.pdf', 'file_path': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-10.pdf', 'page': 2, 'total_pages': 21, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': ' ', 'author': 'User', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'www.freepdfconvert.com         ', 'producer': 'http://www.freepdfconvert.com', 'creationDate': \"D:20110419201000-08'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20110530112127+05'30'\", 'trapped': ''}, page_content=\"sri bhagavaan uvaacha \\nbhooya eva mahaabaaho shrinu me paramam vachah \\nyatteham preeyamaanaaya vakshyaami hitakaamyayaa // 10.1 // \\n \\nSri Bhagavan said \\nAgain, O Mighty Armed, listen to My Supreme word, which I, wishing your welfare, will \\ndeclare to you, who are delighted to hear Me. \\n \\nEncouraged by the keen interest shown by Arjuna in the discourses so far and the \\nresultant satisfaction visible in him, The Lord comes forward to repeat what He had told \\nin the previous discourses (Ch.7 to 9) about His essential nature, manifestations and \\nDivine glories.

Krishna having placed the chariot between the two armies \\nparticularly in front of Bhishma and Drona, asked Arjuna to behold the Kurus. Having \\nseen the kinsmen, Arjuna was filled with compassion and sadness and threw away his \\narms and sank into the seat of the chariot. His personality was destroyed by his \\noverwhelming emotions erupting at the sight of his near and dear ones on the battlefront. \\n \\nThe 2nd Chapter begins with Sanjaya telling Dhritarashtra about the dialogue between \\nKrishna and Arjuna when the latter continues to remain under the spell of melancholy \\nand dejection. Arjuna, with a false sense of renunciation, argues that he would rather live \\non alms than slay the noble elders like Bhishma and Drona and that even an undisputed \\nsovereignty over all the worlds would not drive away his grief. Arguing thus, he \\nexpressed his unwillingness to fight and became silent completely burnt out. \\n \\nThis is one of the longest Chapters in the Gita. \\n \\nThe Text \\n \\nKRISHNA REBUKES ARJUNA \\n \\nsanjaya uvaacha \\ntam tathaa kripayaavishtam ashrupoornaakulekshanam \\nvisheedantam idam vaakyam uvaacha madhusoodanah  // 2.1 // \\n \\nSanjaya said \\nTo him who was thus overwhelmed with pity and sorrow and whose eyes were dimmed \\nwith tears, Madhusudana (Krishna) spoke these words. \\n \\nThe second chapter starts with a brief reference to the sad mental condition of Arjuna. \\nHis pity was not compassion but a form of self-indulgence.

Arjuna, in whom manliness was in full all along, suddenly sunk into un-\\nmanliness at the moment of a crisis.  The Lord rouses him from this set-back.

Strength is life; weakness is death. \\n \\nThe three words used by the Lord are ‘anaryajushtam’, ‘asvargyam’ and ‘akirtikaram’. \\nThey mean respectively three types of persons. 1.

When even using \\nsoft words against them was considered sin, Arjuna was surprised about his being \\nexhorted to wage war against them with arrows. \\n \\nArjuna continued that it would be better for him to eat food by begging, which was most \\nunbecoming for a man of warrior class, than to slay his noble elders on the Kaurava side. \\nHe felt that even if they were killed, his subsequent enjoyment would be stained with \\ntheir blood and therefore not worth anything and the life in this world would be nothing \\nbut hell. \\n \\nA question arises, why is it that Bhishma and Drona, who are not his enemies, are on the \\nside of Duryodhana? They are there because as Arjuna says Bhishma and Drona are \\n‘arthakaman’, which means even though they never approved the criminal ways of \\nDuryodhana, they still sought, accepted and enjoyed the royal hospitality of Duryodhana \\nfor so long that they now feel obligated to him so much that they simply cannot abandon \\nDuryodhana in his time of need. That is how Bhishma and Drona are now caught on the \\nside of Duryodhana. Arjuna feels that it is their problem and he has nothing to do with it \\nand so he sticks to his point of view that they are worthy of his worship. \\n \\nHe had also said that Duryodhana and his companions being goaded by greed were \\nprepared to wage war; but for himself if he wages war, he will enjoy only blood-stained \\npleasure in the form of wealth and sensual enjoyment. Thus he perceives nothing but evil \\nin waging war. \\n \\nWhen an evil comes to us in the form of an evil, it is easier to do away with it, than when \\nit comes in the garb of something good. Ravana could not be recognized by Sita because \\nhe disguised himself as a sage while Krishna killed Kamsa and others recognizing them \\nas evil forces.

The cause for Arjuna’s suffering and distress is because when he looked at his \\nrelatives, friends and teachers lined up on the opposite side, the feeling of ‘me’ and \\n‘mine’ became very strong in him, the central point being the sense of ‘I.’ A man is \\ngrieved when he categorizes some objects or persons as his own and some others as not \\nhis own. This sense of mine and not-mine - attachment for things considered as one’s \\nown and indifference for things considered as not one’s own - is called ego which is the \\nsource of all grief, worry, fear and confusion. Rediscovering oneself to be really higher \\nthan one’s ego is the end of all sorrows arising out of false identification or relationship. \\n \\nSo Krishna went to the bottom of this grief, sorrow, misery and suffering and explained \\nthat a wise man does not have the sense of ‘I’, ‘me’ and ‘mine’. Such a man is not bound \\nby any tie or attachment of any kind. \\n \\n2. Here the phrase ‘those not to be grieved for’ refers to Bhishma and Drona.Why they \\nare not to be grieved for? It is because they are beyond the sense of attachment and the \\nfeeling of “I’ ‘my’ and ‘mine’. That is the reason why they are on the side of the Kaurava \\narmy despite the Pandavas being equally dear to them. They are aware of the difference \\nbetween the real and the unreal, the soul and the body respectively. They are wise \\nbecause they have realized the eternal reality behind the phenomenal changes and \\ntherefore do not grieve at the decay and death of the finite and the mortal in the form of \\nthe physical bodies.  \\n \\nWhen we go to the sea shore we do not grieve over each wave that rises and dissolves for \\nwe know that they are unreal and the real thing is the water in the waves. Waves are like \\nthe physical bodies which appear and disappear while the indweller of the body, the self \\nor soul is like the water. Those who have realized this eternal truth have no sorrow for the \\nchange they perceive in the world of happenings. \\n \\nThus both real and unreal are not to be grieved at as the real is imperishable and therefore \\nshould not be grieved for. The unreal is bound to perish, as it is perishing at every \\nmoment, so it should not also be grieved at. It follows that Arjuna’s grief over the bodies \\nof his relatives getting perished is misplaced and is the consequence of his ignorance, \\nlack of right knowledge, avidya although his words apparently look wise which in fact \\nthey are not. Hence Krishna says that he is grieving for those who should not be grieved \\nfor.  \\n \\nWhat Krishna means is “Arjuna, Look at those standing before you not as human beings; \\nlook at them as the souls (atman) and the soul is immortal; you cannot kill the soul if you \\nhave the real knowledge”. The idea is, “You are sorrowing for those who are eternal in \\nthe real sense, and therefore who are not to be grieved for. Hence you are a fool”. \\n \\n “The wise do not mourn for the dead or for the living,” says Krishna to Arjuna. Why? \\nBecause there are no “living” or “dead” in the sense that those with bodies are alive and \\nthose divested of a body are dead. Nor is there such a duality called life and death. These \\nare only the illusions produced by the distorting veils of ignorance. “Lead me from death \\nto immortality” is not a petition to gain a state where we will nevermore experience \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-2.pdf', 'file_path': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-2.pdf', 'page': 11, 'total_pages': 55, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'SAANKHYA YOGAH :', 'author': 'User', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'www.freepdfconvert.com         ', 'producer': 'http://www.freepdfconvert.com', 'creationDate': \"D:20101026105700-08'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20110530093822+05'30'\", 'trapped': ''}, page_content='bodily death, but a plea to be led from the outward-turned consciousness that produces \\ndeath to the inward-turned consciousness that produces life.

All the subsequent \\nteachings are an elaboration of the principle laid down in this verse.  \\n \\nHe advised Arjuna to renounce his physical, emotional and intellectual estimate of his \\ngrand-sire and teacher and to re-evaluate the situation from his spiritual understanding \\nwhereby his problem at the battlefield would vanish. \\n \\nna twevaaham jaatu naasam  na twam neme janaadhipaah \\nna chaiva na bhavishyaamah sarve vayam atah param // 2.12 // \\n \\nIt is not that I did not exist before, nor you nor these kings.

Calm man means he who has \\nSelf-Knowledge and does not grieve at it means that he does not grieve at death. \\n \\nIn the progress of growth of the body, childhood dies when youth is born and youthhood \\ndies when the old age sets in.  Even when childhood or youthhood no longer remains at \\nthe old age, man remembers his early days fairly well. Thus `something\\' is common \\nthroughout the various stages of growth which could remember the past experiences and \\nnone feels unhappy about these changes. \\n \\nFor the SELF in this body, as is obtaining the change in the experiences of childhood, \\nyouth and old age, so also is the change in the experiences on obtaining another body. A \\nwise person is not confused or overpowered by such change in experiences. \\n \\nLet us understand this statement properly. The Indweller - The self in one\\'s body is the \\nsame in one\\'s childhood, youth and old age; similarly, on obtaining another body, the \\nIndweller in that new body also is the same self or atman.  \\n \\nChildhood, youth and old age are only with respect to one\\'s physical body.

It is the same atman which is the Indweller in any new body one may \\nassume later, after the present body falls. There can never be a time when atman is not \\nthere. Thus at all times, \"I am\" does not change, but \"what I am\" may change. A wise \\nperson is not confused or overpowered by such changes. If one thinks that \"I\" changes \\nfrom \"childhood I\" to \"youth I\" to \"old-age I\" and to another \"I\" in another body, one \\nmust simply ask oneself the question who is \"That I\" who recognizes all these changes in \\n\"I\"s. That \"I\" - That Recognizer I - That Seer I - \"That Knower - I\" is indeed atman, The \\nSELF which is Eternal - All-pervading, and  is never subject to change. \\n \\nThe Self does not die at the cessation of the childhood stage nor is it born again at the \\ncommencement of the youth stage and so also with the next stage of the old age. As the \\nSelf passes unchanged from one stage of the physical body into another stage so it passes \\nunchanged from one body into another. As one does not grieve for the body when it \\npasses through childhood, youth and old age, similarly one should not worry or get \\nhimself deluded over when the soul passes over to another body at physical death. Thus \\nbirth and death are spoken of with regard to the physical body and not the soul. \\n \\nAt the moment of death, there is no extinction of the individual.

The sense organs are the channels through which the perceiving-ego \\ngathers the knowledge of the objects such as touch, sound, form, smell and taste. If this \\nprocess of perceiver contacting the objects through sense organs does not take place the \\nobjects as such can not bring any response or reaction in any individual. \\n \\nThe object remaining the same it can give different experiences to the same individual at \\ndifferent times or at the same time to different individuals.

The unreal is that which does not remain the same for \\ntwo successive moments. Whatever did not exist in the past or will not exist in the future \\ncannot really exist in the present. That which is not in the beginning and which will not \\nbe in the end, but which seemingly exists in the present is called un-Real. Any object \\nconditioned by the law pf cause and effect is not absolutely real because every effect is a \\nchange brought about by a cause and every cause is temporary. \\n \\nThe life is finite. The body changes every moment, mind evolves and intellect grows with \\nthe passage of time.  Each change in the body for example from childhood to youth and \\nfrom youth to old age results in the constant death to its previous state. Body, mind and \\nintellect constitute the continuous succession of the changes and all of them cannot be \\nreal. A thing which never remains the same for any given period is un-Real.  The whole \\nof the phenomenal world must be unreal because no one state in it endures even for a \\nfraction of the time. \\n \\nBut there must be some real entity behind these changes.  For the changes to take place \\nthere must be some changeless substratum just as a river bed is necessary for the rivers to \\nflow.  In order to hold together innumerable experiences at the levels of body, mind and \\nintellect and to give them a cohesive whole which is called life, a changeless substratum \\nis required for all. \\n \\nThat something which remains unchanged all through the changes is The Real and it is \\nnothing other than the Self in all, the Pure Awareness, and Consciousness. What is \\nchanging must be unreal and what is constant must be real. When the soul is overpowered \\nby ignorance, the un-Real which is the names and forms of the phenomenal world, veils \\nthe unchanging reality - the Atman, Consciousness -  which is for ever manifest and \\nwhich is not conditioned by causality.

Birth and death \\nare for the physical bodies only and they cannot touch the immortal Self just as the waves \\nare born and die in the ocean but the ocean itself is not born with the waves nor does it \\ndie when the waves disappear. \\n \\nArjuna was grieved about the death of his kinsmen in the war. So the Lord explains that \\nthe soul is not killed when the body is slain and hence he should not grieve. \\n \\nWHY THE SOUL DOES NOT KILL ANYBODY? \\n \\nvedaavinaashinam nityam ya enam ajam avyayam \\nkatham sa purushah paartha kam ghaatayati hanti kam  // 2.21 // \\n \\nWhosoever knows Him to be indestructible, eternal, unborn and immutable, how can that \\nman slay O Arjuna, or cause another to slay? \\n \\nAn enlightened person who knows the changelessness and the indestructibility of the Self \\ncannot perform the function of slaying or cause another to slay. When we know the Self \\nto be invulnerable, how can anyone slay it?  The words ‘how can he slay' refer to Arjuna \\nand `cause another to slay’ refer to Krishna's own role.  \\n \\nSummarizing what has been said so far Krishna emphasizes that those who know the \\nnature of the Self shall have no dejection or sorrow in the face of the realities of life. \\nTherefore, one while discharging duty should not grieve, while slaying anyone or causing \\nanyone to be slain, but should discharge one’s duty, in accordance with the ordinance of \\nscriptures. \\n \\nILLUSTRATION REGARDING INDESTRUCTIBILITY OF THE SOUL. \\n \\nvaasaamsi jeernaani yathaa vihaaya \\nnavaani grihnaati naro'paraani \\ntathaa shareeraani vihaaya jeernaa \\nnyanyaani samyaati navaani dehee // 2.22 // \\n \\nJust as a man casts off his worn-out clothes and puts on new ones, so also the embodied \\nSelf casts off Its worn out bodies and enters that are new. \\n\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-2.pdf', 'file_path': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-2.pdf', 'page': 19, 'total_pages': 55, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'SAANKHYA YOGAH :', 'author': 'User', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'www.freepdfconvert.com         ', 'producer': 'http://www.freepdfconvert.com', 'creationDate': \"D:20101026105700-08'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20110530093822+05'30'\", 'trapped': ''}, page_content=\" \\nHere 'dehi' means the jiva - the individual person, who is made up of the perceptible \\ngross physical body, the imperceptible subtle and causal bodies, together with the atman.  \\n \\nThe verse says:  Just as an individual person gives up worn out or old clothing and takes \\nup new  ones, similarly, the same jiva, on giving up the worn out or old gross physical \\nbody,  naturally takes up an appropriate new gross physical body. By giving up the old \\nclothes and putting on new ones, the person does not change. Similarly, by giving up the \\nold body and assuming a new one, the atman in the jiva - the individual person - does not \\nchange.   The `worn out condition of the body' does not refer to its biological condition \\nbut to the capacity of the body, mind and intellect equipments to earn the required \\nexperiences from the available environment for facilitating their evolutionary journey. \\nThis evolution and change is for the physical bodies and not for the Self. \\n \\nThe verse also tells something more about every individual person. By virtue of one's \\nown 'karma' the jiva already becomes ready to assume a new body, prior to casting out \\nthe old worn-out body which has served its purpose.  In other words, the mental make-up \\nof a person does not die along with the death of the gross body. The mental make-up of \\nthe person, along with its karma-born tendencies and dispositions is called the subtle-\\nbody which is the core of every jiva and it survives the death of the physical frame. In its \\nnext step of evolution, the jiva assumes a new physical frame more suited to the \\nfulfillment of its natural tendencies and dispositions. In all these changes, the self or soul \\nor the Atman remains unchanged. In reality, the soul being immobile and non-active does \\nnot migrate from one body to another; it is ever fixed and steady and does not undergo \\nany change whatsoever. \\n \\nBut just as when a pot is carried from one place to another, the space within the pot also \\nappears be carried, even so when the subtle body leaves a gross body and enters another, \\nit appears that the soul also has moved from one body to another. Therefore, the acts of \\nleaving one body and entering into another are attributed to the soul in order to explain \\nthe phenomenon of death to the lay people. The word ‘dehi’ is indicative of the soul \\nidentifying itself with gross body it appears to be leaving and entering into another. In \\nthis sense it is said that the soul leaves a worn-out body and enters into a new one. \\n \\nNow a question arises why this cycle of birth and death has been going on from times \\nimmemorial. While this question can be answered from the Jnana, Bhakti and Karma \\npoints of view, the basic factor behind this never-ending cycle is that God has granted the \\nchoice to the living beings to make proper use of their lives and to rediscover ultimately \\ntheir own transcendental nature. Through innumerable births in the relative world they \\ngain experience, through experience knowledge and through knowledge attain freedom or \\nliberation or moksha from this cycle. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-2.pdf', 'file_path': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-2.pdf', 'page': 20, 'total_pages': 55, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'SAANKHYA YOGAH :', 'author': 'User', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'www.freepdfconvert.com         ', 'producer': 'http://www.freepdfconvert.com', 'creationDate': \"D:20101026105700-08'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20110530093822+05'30'\", 'trapped': ''}, page_content='Concepts and Issues \\n \\nKrishna started the sermon of the Gita by stating that  \\n \\n1. The Self within is eternal, indestructible.  \\n2. The bodies enveloping the Self are ephemeral and have a beginning and an end.  \\n3. Death is certain for the born and birth for the dead.  \\n4. Beings pass through this cycle of birth and death repeatedly but the indwelling \\nSelf remains eternally the same.  \\nThe one who understands these concepts is said to possess true knowledge which \\npostulates that the soul or self or the atman alone is real and all things other than that are \\nunreal.  \\n \\nThe entire existence with respect to an individual is divided into two categories: 1. ‘I’ or \\naham and 2. ‘This’ or idam. Atman is ‘I’ and the rest is ‘This’ idam.  But due to the \\nignorance of my real nature, I am always identified with my body, mind and intellect and \\nthus developed a false notion about myself. This false notion is ego.  \\n \\nIf I can differentiate what is different from me, I can apprehend my own nature. Thus the \\nenquiry is to know first what is not I and then to assert what is I. In other words it is about \\nknowing what is not I (the body, mind and intellect) and knowing my real nature i.e. \\nAtman (I). This is the study of the nature of the atman and the body which is called \\nSarira Traya Prakriya.  \\n \\nThe personality of an individual is considered to consist of three bodies or ‘sarira’ viz. \\ngross body (sthula sarira), subtle body (sukshma sarira) and causal body (karana sarira). \\n \\n \\nGross body (Sthula Sarira): It is that which is composed of the five great elements viz. \\nspace, air, fire, water and earth. The volume of the body occupies ‘space’, the breathing \\nand respiratory system is due to ‘air’, the warmth in the body is due to ‘fire’ and the body \\nis made up of ‘water’ and the ‘minerals’(earth). This physical body is considered to have \\nbeen acquired as a result of past good deeds. This body is the locus or the hutment or the \\ncounter for experiencing pain and pleasure and such other pairs of opposites. It is subject \\nto six modifications (shad vikaras) viz. existence, birth, growth, change, decay and death. \\n \\nSubtle body (Sukshma Sarira or Linga Sarira): It is the counterpart of the gross body that \\nkeeps the latter alive, performs all the physiological functions and operates the organs of \\naction and perception. The physical body dies when the subtle body departs. The subtle \\nbody consists of seventeen components.  They are the five organs of perception, the five \\norgans of action, the five vital airs (Pancha Pranas), the mind and the intellect.  \\nThe five organs of perception are 1. Ear (sense of hearing), 2. Skin (sense of touch), 3. \\nEyes (sense of vision), 4. Tongue (sense of taste) and 5. Nose (sense of smell). The five \\norgans of action are 6. Mouth, 7. Hands, 8. Legs, 9. Anus and 10. Genitals. The five vital \\nairs are: 11. Prana - its function being respiration - located in Nose 12. Apana - Evacation \\nor Excretion - Anus & Genitals 13.

In the world of change, objects meet their end by means of \\ninstruments of destruction like weapons, fire, water and wind.  \\n \\nArjuna’s grief was based on the assumption that he would be killing the elders and other \\nrealtives by striking them with lethal weapons.

The body is perishable \\nand possessed of a form; the soul is everlasting and formless.

Free yourself from the pairs of opposites and ever remain in the quality of \\nsattwa (goodness), freed from all thoughts of acquisition (of what you lack) and \\npreservation (of what you have) and be established in the Self. \\n \\nAfter advising Arjuna about the ineffectiveness of the blind obedience to the Karma \\nKanda, Sri Krishna tells him to transcend himself from the triple Gunas. Guna means \\nattribute or quality.  Nature is made of three Gunas viz., Sattwa - purity, light, harmony; \\nRajas - passion, restlessness, motion; and Tamas - inertia, and darkness. These three \\nGunas remain in all the living creatures in varying degrees.  The mind and intellect are \\nconstituted with these qualities. Going above these temperaments means going beyond \\nthe mind and intellect to re-discover one to be the Supreme Self. How such transportation \\nfrom imperfection to perfection can take place is explained here. \\n \\nPairs of opposites like heat and cold, pleasure and pain, victory and defeat, honor and \\ndishonor, praise and censure etc. are the experiences of man in his life.  To ever remain in \\nthe quality of Sattwa means to keep oneself least agitated in one's perceptions of objects \\nand persons and in the assessment of their true nature.  \\n \\nEvery activity in this world is guided by two prime motives viz. acquisition for purposes \\nof possession and preservation of possessions acquired. These two motives in all actions \\nindicate our selfish desire to acquire and hoard. Renouncing these two temperaments \\nimplies getting away from the source of restlessness and sorrows in life. \\n \\nSri Krishna advises Arjuna the practical method to be free from all the pairs of opposites \\nand from the thought of acquisition and preservation and ever remaining in the quality of \\nSattwa by establishing himself in the Self by remaining on guard and not yielding to the \\nobjects of the senses.  The sorrows of the pairs of the opposites, the temptation to be \\nimpure and the desire for acquiring and preserving  all belong to the ego-centre arising \\nout of the Self identifying with not-Self i.e. body, mind and intellect. \\n \\nTo keep ourselves detached from these ego-centric ideas through constant awareness of \\nour pure divine nature is the path shown by The Lord to establish oneself in the Self \\nwhen the individual ego finds itself free from all anxieties of the world. Necessarily then \\none will be beyond the three Gunas free from the pairs of opposites remaining always in \\nthe Sattwic quality. This attitude implies that one should be balanced and not swayed by \\neither extremes.

In this path towards progress, a complete erasure of \\nindividuality and its false sense of values are essential. \\n \\nEvenness of mind, tranquility of mental composure in all pairs of opposites, is Yoga. In \\nthis context the term Yoga indicates a special condition of mind in which it comes to a \\nneutral equilibrium in all the ups and downs of life's situations.

They eulogize the ritualistic portion of the Vedas \\nand declare in flowery speech that there is nothing beyond these rituals. \\nØ Despite regular performance of the rituals their attention in life remains focused \\non enjoying the pleasures and power in the world. \\nØ Such people possess a vacillating mind unable to concentrate and meditate on the \\nSuprem Self. \\n \\nV ~ DESIRELESS ACTIONS LEAD TO SELF-REALIZATION ~ VERSES 45 – 53 \\n \\nØ The Vedas deal with three gunas – sattwa, rajas and tamas.

This underscores the \\nfact that the spiritual quest involves directing the mind within by withdrawing it from \\nobjects. When the mind engages in the world it is constantly subjected to attachment, \\nlikes and dislikes, and anger because the external factors are not under one’s control. To \\nrealize one’s true nature as the Self (Atman) within it is necessary to exercise control \\nover the mind by restraining its tendency to do what it likes.  \\nIf the mind is given the freedom to do what it wants only constant restlessness would \\nresult as a result of desires that arise one after another. This prods the individual to action \\nto fulfill his desires giving rise to frustration and anger when they are not fulfilled. Even \\nwhen he is able to realize his desires the joy that he enjoys is fleeting and thus the quest \\nfor worldly joy only subjects the person to further bondage by his actions. To become \\nfree from this quagmire, which traps man, is the objective of spiritual quest. The basic \\nrequirement then is disentanglement from the world slowly by restraining the mind. \\nAs long as an individual is subject to bondage—due to ignorance of his true spiritual \\nnature—his identification will be with his body and his actions will be to preserve and \\npamper it, while a man of wisdom (Jnani) will identify with the Self and thus be free \\nfrom attachment to his body.  \\nThe equanimity of mind that a Jnani has is a consequence of his constant abiding in the \\nSelf, which is tranquil and blissful. The afflictions of his body will not disturb his mind as \\nhe is aware of their transience. The relationship between the body and the mind is an \\nillusion created due to superimposition (Adhyasa), which is primordial. Just as the Moon \\nshines because of the Sun’s light, so also does the mind acquire the properties of the \\nobjects it engages with. When the mind attains union with the Self it reflects its serenity \\nand bliss. \\n \\nKrishna’s advice to Arjuna is to have equanimity of mind to achieve the ultimate \\nobjective. He says, “One who has control over the mind is tranquil in heat and cold, in \\npleasure and pain, in honor and dishonor and is ever steadfast with the Supreme Self”. \\nThis is in accordance with the saying in the Rig Veda “The mind is fickle like a fast \\ngalloping horse and the only way to control it is by involving it in good actions beneficial \\nfor the welfare of all”. \\n \\nIf a man can control his mind he can find the way to enlightenment and all wisdom and \\nvirtue will naturally come to him.

Here Lord Krishna \\ncategorically and comprehensively explains how it is the duty of each and every member \\nof society to carry out their functions and responsibilities in their respective stage of life \\naccording to the rules and regulations of the society in which one lives. Further the          \\nLord explains why such duties must be performed, what benefit is gained by performing \\nthem, what harm is caused by not performing them, what actions lead to bondage and \\nwhat actions lead to salvation. All these points relating to duty have been described in \\ngreat detail. Hence this chapter is entitled “Karma Yogah : Yoga Of Action”. \\n \\nIn the previous Chapter Bhagavan advised that Arjuna's duty was to work without pre-\\noccupying himself with its result and at the same time suggested that he should not be \\nattached to inaction. He concluded His advice with the advocacy of the path of attaining \\nthe state of steady wisdom and Brahmi state by knowledge and renunciation.  \\n \\nArjuna feels confused by the Lord’s praise of righteous war (2.31-38) and the Buddhi \\nYoga i.e. equanimity of mind (2.49 & 50) as also about the man of steady wisdom in \\nconclusion. These apparently conflicting views seem to have perplexed Arjuna as to \\nwhich path he has to adopt for his self-development i.e. whether it is knowledge or action \\nor either together or total renunciation of both. The advice of The Lord here is that \\nselfless action performed in a spirit of dedication and surrender and with pure motive is \\nthe right path. \\n \\nThe Text  \\n     \\nWHY THEN WORK AT ALL?  \\n \\narjuna uvaacha \\njyaayasee chet karmanaste mataa buddhir janaardana \\ntat kim karmani ghore maam niyojayasi keshava  // 3.1 // \\n \\nArjuna said \\nIf you think that knowledge is superior to action, O Janardana, why then do you ask me \\nto engage in this terrible action, O Kesava? \\n \\nvyaamishreneva vaakyena  buddhim mohayaseeva me \\ntadekam vada nishchitya  yena shreyo'ham aapnuyaam  // 3.2 // \\n \\nWith these apparently perplexing words you confuse my understanding, as it were; \\ntherefore, tell me definitely that one thing by which I may attain the Highest Goal.  \\n\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-3.pdf', 'file_path': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-3.pdf', 'page': 2, 'total_pages': 28, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Srimad Bhagavad Gita', 'author': 'User', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'www.freepdfconvert.com         ', 'producer': 'http://www.freepdfconvert.com', 'creationDate': \"D:20101202194900-08'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20110530094346+05'30'\", 'trapped': ''}, page_content=\"Arjuna misunderstands the teaching that work for reward is less excellent than work \\nwithout attachment and desire and believes that Sri Krishna is of the view that knowledge \\nwithout action is better than work.

Longing is \\nan expectation of a happening at a future point of time. Ego is one's own self-estimation \\nbased on his past.  To act without ego and longing thus means acting without the \\nmemories of the past or the anxieties about the future but to live in the present.

This anxiety and \\nworry is what is called here as mental fever or perturbance. \\n \\nThe idea is that we must engage in work by self-surrender to the Lord who presides over \\ncosmic existence and activity. “Thy will be done” should be our attitude in all work.

For fear that Arjuna may misunderstand this advice as the only way for \\nthe self-development Lord Krishna reveals in this chapter how spiritual knowledge is \\nreceived by successive disciples and the reason and nature of His descent into the \\nmaterial worlds. He also explains the paths of action and knowledge as well as the \\nwisdom regarding the supreme knowledge which results at the culmination of the two \\npaths. Thus this chapter dealing with the paths of action and knowledge is entitled: ‘The \\nYoga of Renunciation of Action in Knowledge’. In a way this Chapter can be considered \\nas an Appendix to the Third Chapter. \\n \\nIn this Chapter we can observe Sri Krishna talking to Arjuna not as his friend or \\ncharioteer but as an omnipotent and omniscient God probably to instill in his mind the \\nnecessary reverence and respect for Him and His teachings. \\n \\nThe Text  \\n \\nTRADITION OF JNAANA YOGA \\n \\nsri bhagavaan uvaacha \\nimam vivaswate yogam proktavan aham avyayam \\nvivaswaan manave praaha manur ikshwaakave'braveet // 4.1 // \\n \\nSri Bhagavan said \\nI taught this eternal Yoga to Vivasvan; he taught it to Manu and Manu proclaimed it to \\nIkshvaku. \\n \\nThis eternal yoga means the yoga taught in the Second and Third Chapters.

Hence he sees action in what the ignorant think to be inaction. \\n \\nPerformed all actions: \\nA wise person devoid of the idea of agency is really a free soul, though he participates in \\naction. Action does not bind him. \\n \\nThe terms ‘action’ and ‘inaction’ are not rightly understood; the one is mistaken for the \\nother. The Lord tries to remove this misunderstanding. The Self of man is actionless. \\nAction pertains to the physical body, the senses and the mind. But an ignorant person \\nfalsely attributes action to the Self and says to himself that ‘I am the doer, mine is the \\naction, and by me is the fruit of action reaped’ and so on.  \\n \\nSimilarly, he falsely imputes to the Self the cessation of activity, which really pertains to \\nthe body, the senses and the mind. So he says to himself ‘I shall be quiet, I may be free \\nfrom work and worry and be happy’ and so on. \\n \\nThrough right knowledge a man sees inaction in action; he sees that action commonly \\nassociated with the Self really belongs to the body, the senses and the mind and that the \\nSelf is actionless. Likewise, a man with right knowledge sees action in inaction; he \\nknows that inaction is also a kind of action. Inaction is a correlative of action and pertains \\nto the body. The Self is beyond action and inaction. \\n \\nSankara explains that in atman there is no action; in the body, however, there is no rest, \\neven when there seems to be rest. \\n \\nHe who knows the meaning of action and inaction as explained above is wise among \\nmen; he is a Yogi.

When a seeker constantly practices the different \\ntypes of Yajnas suggested in this section he gains wisdom. With the dawn of wisdom he \\nbegins to develop renunciation and perceives the identity of the atman and brahman. \\n \\nYajna in the ancient past merely meant the ritual of fire worship by kindling the flames \\nwith the offerings therein by the people. Krishna gives a new interpretation to the word \\nYajna to mean the conversion of human day to day activities into worship. The cycle of \\nhuman activity starts with the receipt of stimuli from the world at large by the organs of \\nperception, which turn them into reaction in mind and intellect, and which are returned as \\na response back into the world through the organs of action. This entire cycle has been \\nsplit into twelve main activities; each of them turned into a ritual, worship, a Yajna. \\nThose who understand this and turn their daily activities into a practice of these yajnas \\nwill free themselves from the vasanas / desires. \\n \\nThis concept of viewing daily activities as a Yajna can be further explained in simpler \\nterms. Take for instance the most common activities of eating and reading. This can be \\nstated in the Gita language as “People offer the sense of hunger as sacrifice in the fire of \\nfood; others offer the sense of ignorance as sacrifice in the fire of the knowledge”. What \\ndoes this mean? It simply means that food satisfies hunger or hunger is burnt in the \\nYajnakund of food or hunger is burnt by food or just hunger is satiated by consuming \\nfood. Similarly, knowledge removes ignorance or ignorance is burnt in the sacrificial fire \\nof knowledge or ignorance is burnt (removed) by knowledge or just ignorance disappears \\nwhen knowledge dawns. \\n \\nBy converting activities into Yajna (worship) a seeker drops his vasanas and gradually \\ngains knowledge of the Self. The supermost of all yajnas is jnana yajna, the yajna of \\nWisdom. A seeker should prepare himself for the yajna through devotion, enquiry and \\nservice. With such preparation he will attract a perfect Guru to teach him the knowledge \\nof the Self. This knowledge of the Self destroys all desires and agitations and removes \\nforever his delusion that the world is real.  \\n \\nThe knowledge of Self purifies the mind of all agitations and gives supreme Peace. Those \\ndevoted to Self control their senses and pursue the Self with consistency until they reach \\nit. The ignorant, ever doubtful of the Self, lack steadiness of purpose. They will not \\nachieve anything in this world or the next nor will they find any enduring happiness. \\nKrishna, therefore, advises Arjuna to gain knowledge and remove all doubts and delusion \\nand thus become established in the Supreme Self.  \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-4.pdf', 'file_path': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-4.pdf', 'page': 19, 'total_pages': 30, 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'title': 'Jnaana Karma Sanyaasa Yogah :', 'author': 'User', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'www.freepdfconvert.com         ', 'producer': 'http://www.freepdfconvert.com', 'creationDate': \"D:20101217172400-08'00'\", 'modDate': \"D:20110530105026+05'30'\", 'trapped': ''}, page_content=\"The Text  \\n \\ndaivamevaapare yajnam yoginah paryupaasate \\nbrahmaagnaavapare yajnam yajnenaivopajuhwati // 4.25 // \\n \\nSome Yogis offer oblations or perform sacrifice to Devas alone (Deva-yagna); while \\nothers offer the Self as sacrifice by the Self into the fire of Brahman (Brahma Yagna). \\n \\nSri Krishna explains the mental attitude of a saint when he comes in contact with the \\nworld and functions in it. The Lord is enumerating in these verses twelve different types \\nof Yagnas, each one apparently meaning ritualism but in fact suggesting different \\npatterns of life wherein by the necessary adjustments in the mind we can effectively \\nchange the entire reactions of the world upon us. \\n \\nDeva Yagna - Some Yogis perform sacrifice to Devas alone: According to ritualism this \\nmeans invoking the grace of a specific deity and offering oblations to it in the sacred fire \\nfor gaining its blessings.  But here it means that the perfect masters (Yogis) when they \\nmove in the world do perceive objects but their understanding and experience of the \\nperception is of such a nature that the world of objects was subservient to the five sense \\norgans which are Devas.  When this mental attitude is entertained by the seeker, he feels \\ndetached from the sense experience and is able to have a sense of inner equanimity. It is \\nsurrendering individual consciousness to Cosmic Consciousness. \\n \\nBrahma Yagna - Offering the Self as a sacrifice by the Self in the fire of Brahman: The \\nouter world by itself is incapable of giving us sorrow or joy; but it is our attitude towards \\nthe objects and situations of the outer world that brings us such feelings. The perfect \\nmasters understand that the sense organs are mere instruments of perception and tune \\nthem to sacrifice themselves in the knowledge of the Brahman. When an individual's \\norgans of perception and action are to function not for satisfying his selfish needs but for \\nthe sake of serving the society at large, then although he lives in the world of objects he \\nwill not have any attachment to them. \\n \\nThe limiting accessories such as body, mind and intellect which are super imposed on the \\nSelf through ignorance are subordinated and the identity of the individual soul with the \\nSupreme Soul is realized. The offering of the Self in the Brahman is to know that the Self \\nwhich is associated with the limiting adjuncts is identical with the unconditioned \\nSupreme Brahman. This is called Brahma Yagna wherein the Self is divested of Its \\nUpadhis or limiting adjuncts so that it is recognized as the Supreme Self or Brahman.  \\n \\nBrahman is described in the scriptures as Consciousness, Knowledge and Bliss and as the \\ninnermost Self of all.

To Arjuna action meant ritualism and renunciation \\nmeant a total retirement from everything and running away to a place of solitude. Sri \\nKrishna attempts here to give deeper insights to these oft misunderstood terms. The Lord \\npropounds the theory of self-development in three stages viz. through desire-prompted \\nactivities, through desireless activities and through pure meditation.  \\n \\nHaving practiced the Yajnas prescribed in the preceding chapter and gained wisdom, a \\nseeker sheds his vasanas / desires and develops a dispassion for the world. He enters into \\na state of renunciation, an essential pre-requisite for practicing meditation. This chapter \\nelucidates this stage of development preliminary to meditation and realization. \\n \\nThis Chapter answers the questions: What is the spirit of renunciation? How the Yoga of \\nrenunciation of action can be practiced? What are its effects on the human personality? \\nThus this Chapter deals with both Action and Knowledge and is therefore a link between \\nKarma Yoga and Pure Meditation. \\n \\nIn the opening verse of the chapter Arjuna asks Krishna to advise him conclusively as to \\nwhich is better of the two – the path of action or the path of renunciation. Krishna \\nclarifies the doubt by explaining the three distinct stages of spiritual growth. A seeker \\nembarking on his spiritual journey with vasanas / desires is termed Yogi. Through Karma \\nYoga, the path of action, he sheds the bulk of his vasanas. As he does so, he becomes \\ndispassionate towards the world and becomes an ascetic, a Sanyasi. A Sanyasi following \\nthe path of knowledge practices contemplation and meditation until he reaches the \\nultimate state of realization to become a Jnani, an enlightened soul. Both Karma Yogi and \\nSanyasi reach the supreme goal. Thus, one takes up either the path of action or the path of \\nrenunciation according to one’s basic nature.  \\n \\nThe above three types of individuals (Karma Yogi, Sanyasi, Jnani) relate differently to \\naction. The enlightened one, the Jnani, having merged with the Self, realizes that the Self \\ndoes not act at all. In and through all actions, external and internal, the Jnani remains a \\nsilent witness while the senses contact the sense objects. The Sanyasi, in his state of \\ndispassion, dedicates all his actions to Brahman. He acts without any attachment. \\nConsequently, his actions are not sinful and do not leave a residue of vasanas / desires. \\nSuch a person, like a lotus leaf in water, remains in the world, but detached from and \\nunaffected by it. The Karma Yogi, the one at the beginning of the spiritual journey, \\ndetaches himself from worldly entanglements and directs all his physical, mental and \\nintellectual activities towards his own self purification. \\n \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-5.pdf', 'file_path': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-5.pdf', 'page': 2, 'total_pages': 20, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': 'INTRODUCTION', 'author': 'User', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Acrobat PDFMaker 7.0 for Word', 'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 7.0 (Windows)', 'creationDate': \"D:20110521185231+05'30'\", 'modDate': \"D:20110530110843+05'30'\", 'trapped': ''}, page_content='The Text  \\narjuna uvaacha \\nsannyaasam karmanaam krishna punar yogam cha shamsasi \\nyacchreya etayorekam tanme broohi sunishchitam // 5.1  // \\n \\nArjuna said \\nRenunciation of actions, O Krishna, you praise and again Yoga, performance of actions.  \\nTell me conclusively that which is better of the two. \\n \\nIn Chapter IV, verses 18, 19, 21, 22, 24, 32, 33, 37 and 41 The Lord has spoken of the \\nrenunciation of all actions and in the verse 42 He exhorted Arjuna to engage in Yoga, the \\nperformance of action.

Sensual \\nenjoyments arising out of external contacts have a diminishing value and they culminate \\nin sorrow. The very sight of sense objects inflames desires in people. Then they lose \\ncontrol and succumb to the lure of the sense objects. The wise understand the ephemeral \\nnature of contact-born enjoyments and prevent any desire from developing into an \\nuncontrollable force of momentum. Instead of indulging in such temporary bouts of \\nsensual pleasure they divert their attention and interest to the Self within. Thus they free \\nthemselves gradually from desires, subdue their mind and turn introvert. They begin to \\nrevel in the bliss of the Self.

When one consciously renounces the \\nactivities of the senses, mind and intellect one will surely merge into one's essential \\nnature of the Supreme Consciousness. Thus renunciation or loss of personality becomes a \\nmeans to supreme perfection. This is the glory of wisdom of renunciation. The action \\ndone with freedom from individuality spontaneously unites one with Universality. Such \\nwise sages see divinity everywhere just like the ocean has no difference of feelings \\nbetween one wave and the other. He finds no distinction in the world of names and forms. \\n \\nPoints to Ponder \\n \\n      1. Explain the concepts: \\n¾ The Supreme Self (Prabhuh) neither creates any sense of agency nor does it \\ninitiate any action.  \\n¾ The all-pervading Spirit does not take on the merit or demerit of any.  \\n¾ Knowledge is enveloped in ignorance and hence beings get deluded. \\n2. How does one get established in equanimity? \\n3. Who attains Brahman? \\n4. What are the characteristics of an enlightened soul? \\n5. What are the methods to get oneself liberated?  \\n6.

The first six chapters elucidate the \\nword 'thou' which stands for the individual self. It is called the Twam-pada. The second \\nset of six chapters deals with the word 'that' which denotes brahman. This is called the \\nTat-pada. The last set of six chapters establishes the identity of the individual self and \\nbrahman. It is called the Asi-pada, which establishes the identity of the individual soul \\nwith the Supreme Soul. \\n \\nAnother way of looking at these three sets of six chapters each is to consider the first six \\nchapters as emphasizing karmayoga, the second six bhaktiyoga and the last six \\njnanayoga. The term 'yoga' here stands for 'path'. Thus we have the three paths of karma, \\nbhakti and jnana. These three paths are, however, not independent of one another, but \\nthey together form a synthetic whole. None of these paths can be practiced without the \\nhelp of the other two; only the emphasis varies according to the temperament and level of \\nspiritual development of the aspirant. \\n \\nChapter 2 described the sage of perfection, his mental equipoise and the methods of self-\\nevolution to guide us in pure meditation and detached thinking. Chapter 3 gave a \\nscientific treatment of the Karma Yoga - the path of action. The principle of \\n`Renunciation of action in knowledge' had been propounded in Chapter 4. As there was \\nconfusion in Arjuna between the ideas of `action' and `renunciation of action', Chapter 5 \\nexplained the `way of renunciation of action' under two methods Viz. 1. Renunciation of \\nthe sense of doership and 2. Abandoning attachment and anxiety about the fruits of \\nactions. A person who has followed the teachings of The Lord thus far would have got rid \\noff his doubts. He would be fit for the higher purposes of meditation and Self-\\ncontemplation. How this is done is the theme of the present Chapter 6. This chapter \\nconcludes one of the sections in the thought-flow of the Gita as explained in the \\nbeginning. \\n \\nThis Chapter explains how one can give up one's weaknesses and positively grow into a \\nhealthier, stronger and integrated personality. This technique is called “Dhyana Yoga” or \\n`Path of meditation'. It discusses this path as auxiliary to the practice of both Karma Yoga \\nand Sankhya Yoga. \\n \\nControl over the body, senses, mind and intellect is extremely necessary in Dhyana Yoga. \\nThese instruments are collectively called as “Atma” and hence this Chapter is also called \\n‘The Yoga of Self-Control’. Many classical commentators, particularly Madhusudan \\nSaraswati, have therefore associated this Chapter with the Ashtanga Yoga of Patanjali’s \\nYoga Sutras.   \\n \\n\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-6.pdf', 'file_path': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-6.pdf', 'page': 2, 'total_pages': 30, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': 'Bhagavad Gita: Chapter 2 (Part-5)', 'author': 'User', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Acrobat PDFMaker 7.0 for Word', 'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 7.0 (Windows)', 'creationDate': \"D:20110522181017+05'30'\", 'modDate': \"D:20110530111107+05'30'\", 'trapped': ''}, page_content=\"The first nine verses of this Chapter reiterate the three stages of spiritual development as \\ndescribed in the previous chapter. A yogi with worldly vasanas, needs karma yoga, the \\npath of action, to evolve spiritually. Through action he sheds his vasanas and becomes a \\nSanyasi. A Sanyasi, in a state of renunciation, needs meditation and quietitude to reach \\nthe ultimate state of Jnani.  Both Karma Yogi and Sanyasi aim at the same goal of Self \\nrealization but their sadhanas (spiritual practices) differ. Whatever be the sadhana, every \\nseeker has to put in his own effort to raise himself.  \\n \\nThough the Yogi and Sanyasi are both on the spiritual path, the Sanyasi alone, having \\ndeveloped a dispassion for the world, is capable for meditation and realization. Details of \\nthe environmental, physical, mental and intellectual preparations necessary to take the \\nseat of meditation are elaborated here.  When a seeker follows all these preparations he \\nwill become freed from desire, possessiveness, and the consequent sorrow. He will then \\nbecome established in Yoga and be fully prepared to enter into meditation. \\n \\nThe Text  \\n \\nRENUNCIATION AND ACTION ARE ONE \\n \\nsri bhagavaan uvaacha \\nanaashritah karmaphalam kaaryam karma karoti yah \\nsa sannyaasi cha yogee cha na niragnirna chaakriyah  // 6.1 // \\n \\nSri Bhagavan said \\nHe who performs his bounden duty without depending on the fruits of his actions - he is a \\nsannyasin and a yogin, not he who has merely renounced the sacred fire; even so he is no \\nyogi, who has merely given up all action. \\n \\nSo far, two currents of thought were discussed viz. 1. `Renunciation of the sense of \\nagency' (Sanyas) and 2. `Renunciation of attachment to the fruits of actions' (Yoga). \\n \\nThe Sanyasi is himself the Yogi and the seekers must therefore engage themselves in \\nnoble works renouncing both their sense of doership and attachment to the fruits of their \\nactions. Sanyasa or renunciation has little to do with outward works. It is an inward \\nattitude. It is mental purity and intellectual equipoise. \\n \\nArjuna thought Sanyasa as mere abandonment of all activities, symbolized here by the \\nword `fire'. To become a Sanyasi, it is not necessary to give up the daily sacrificial fire \\nand other rituals. To abstain from these without the spirit of renunciation is futile. \\n \\nyam sannyaasamiti praahuryogam tam viddhi paandava \\nna hyasannyastasankalpo yogee bhavati kashchana  // 6.2 // \\n \\nO Pandava, please know what they call renunciation to be disciplined activity, for none \\nbecomes a Yogi who has not renounced his selfish desire. \\n \\n\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-6.pdf', 'file_path': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-6.pdf', 'page': 3, 'total_pages': 30, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': 'Bhagavad Gita: Chapter 2 (Part-5)', 'author': 'User', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Acrobat PDFMaker 7.0 for Word', 'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 7.0 (Windows)', 'creationDate': \"D:20110522181017+05'30'\", 'modDate': \"D:20110530111107+05'30'\", 'trapped': ''}, page_content=\"The word `Sankalpa' means the mental faculty that makes plans for the future expecting \\nthe results of the plans so made.

The chances for the seeker to \\nmaintain a pure mental condition are more in a clean place. A tidy atmosphere causes the \\nleast mental disturbances. \\n \\nThe meditator should sit steady (sthiram) in his seat without moving his body in any \\ndirection since physical movements destroy the mental concentration and inner equipoise. \\nIn order to get established in a firm posture, it would be advisable to sit in any \\ncomfortable seat with the vertebral column erect, fingers interlocked and hands thrown in \\nfront. \\n \\nThe seat of meditation should not be too high or too low. Too high a seat causes a sense \\nof insecurity and a seat too low may cause bodily pains. During meditation the heart \\nbecomes slightly slow causing even a slight fall in blood pressure and to that extent one \\ngets withdrawn in himself. At such a time of low resistance, the position of the seat plays \\na vital part. \\n \\nThe mattress of Kusa Grass on the ground covered by a deer skin and a piece of cloth on \\ntop of it protects one from dampness, cold and heat. \\n \\nSitting properly by itself is not Yoga. While proper physical condition is necessary for \\ninducing right mental attitude for spiritual practices, by itself it cannot assure any \\nspiritual self development. Hence Sri Krishna tells here what a seeker should do in the \\nseat of meditation having brought his body in a steady condition and how his mind and \\nintellect should be kept engaged.  \\n \\nThese instructions of The Lord are: One should make the mind single pointed by \\nsubduing the faculty of imagination and activities of the sense organs. Although single \\npointedness is the nature of the mind, by virtue of its capacity for imagination or wishful \\nthinking and on account of the pulls and pressures of the external sense objects on the \\nsense organs, it gets wild and scattered. The Lord says that if these two sources of \\ndissipation are closed, the mind will get automatically single pointed. Keeping the mind \\ncontemplating on the Ultimate Self constantly is the inner Yoga suggested here. \\n \\nThe effect of such meditation is inner purification.  A purified mind is the one wherein \\nthere are no agitations and when the mind becomes thus steady and pure, it discovers its \\nown Real Nature just like one understands himself by looking at his own image in a \\nmirror.

He continues the \\ndiscussion in the following verses pointing out that the controlled mind remains peaceful \\nand explaining the process by which the seeker can gain the experience of the Essential \\nSelf through such disciplined mind. By training the mind, one must give up its \\npreoccupation with the world and direct it to the Self within and make it introvert. As \\nsoon as the mind tastes the bliss of the Self it will realize that there is no greater \\nenjoyment. Being established therein, even the greatest of the sorrows in the world \\ncannot disturb its equanimity and peace. One practices that Yoga (union with the Self) \\nthrough complete control of the senses and the thought flow which are the source-point of \\nall desires. This sets the stage for practicing meditation and the realization of the Self.  \\n \\nThe mind in the state of meditation thinks of the Self. The intellect holds the mind single \\npointedly upon the Self without allowing it to slip into any other thought. Whenever the \\nmind wanders away the intellect brings it back through supervision and control. By \\nmaintaining single pointed thought of the Self, the mind becomes absolutely tranquil and \\nquiet. The Jnani then experiences the infinite bliss of Brahman. Thereafter, he sees the \\nSelf in all beings and all beings in the Self. He sees the Supreme Being everywhere.  \\n \\nWhen he heard the exposition on how to discipline and control the mind, Arjuna raises a \\ndoubt as to whether the mind is such a thing which can be controlled at all. He wonders \\nhow the mind, a restless, turbulent, strong and obstinate entity, can be brought under \\ncontrol. And even if forcefully brought under control, how can the mind continue to \\nremain steady and calm? Krishna assures Arjuna that the intellect can control the mind \\nthrough sustained practice and dispassion.  \\n \\nArjuna wonders as to what will happen to a seeker and his efforts if he fails to attain Self-\\nrealization in his lifetime. Will he not be denied the benefits of both the material and \\nspiritual worlds? Krishna allays Arjuna’s logical and natural concern and assures him that \\nno seeker falling short of Realization in his life time will ever suffer either here or \\nhereafter.  Such a person will gain a heavenly bliss and reincarnate in a pure and pious \\nhome or in a family of wise yogis, which will provide him with an ideal environment for \\npursuing spiritual goal of Realization in his new life.

To make the mind withdraw from its nomadic nature for contemplating \\ncontinuously on the Self, which is the substratum that illumines all perceptions and \\nexperiences, one has to make it free from desires.

They end with a call given by The Lord to all mankind to practice \\nthis Yoga of Meditation and self development. \\n \\nThe goal of the meditator is attaining serene quietitude when his mind becomes \\ncompletely restrained and gains an experience of the Self, not as an entity separate from \\nhimself but as his own true nature.  This self discovery of the mind is nothing other than \\nthe process by which ego's identification with body, mind and intellect is replaced by the \\nprinciple of Divine Consciousness. The experience of the self is an enduring state from \\nwhich there is no return. \\n \\nSri Krishna says that having gained this Infinite Bliss, no one can come to the worldly \\nsorrows and feel the urge to go after the worldly objects and pursuits. The Yogi who \\nattained the state of Supreme Truth will consider no other gain as equal to it and worth \\ncomparable. Thus Sri Krishna defines Yoga as a state of “DISUNION FROM EVERY UNION \\nWITH PAIN”. \\n \\nThe term yoga means contact. Man is always in contact with finite worldly objects \\nthrough the instruments of body, mind and intellect and gets finite joy only. When this \\ntemporary joy ends on account of the cessation of the instrumentality of the senses, \\nsorrow begins. Therefore it is said that life through these matter instruments is called the \\nlife of union-with-pain. \\n \\nDetachment from this union is the process in which we disassociate ourselves from the \\nfields of objects and their experiences. As mind cannot exist without any attachment, \\nonce it is detached from the unreal and pain giving world of objects, it has to get itself \\nattached to the Real and Permanent Bliss, which is called meditation. In deep meditation, \\nthe senses do not function; they are resolved into their cause i.e. the mind. And when the \\nmind becomes steady and cognition alone functions, then the indescribable Self is \\nrealized. \\n \\nThus Yoga is nothing but a man's renunciation of contacts with sorrows and turning \\ntowards Bliss which is his real nature. Sri Krishna says that this Yoga is to be practiced \\nwith an eager and decisive mind.  Success in meditation is possible only when it is \\ncarried out with firm conviction, perseverance and an un-despairing heart as the Yoga or \\nconnection with the Real can be gained only with Viyoga or disconnection from the \\nUnreal. There should be no relaxation of effort even though there is no quick result and \\nthe practice appears difficult. If living among the finite objects with its limited joys is \\nsorrow, then to get away from it all is to enter the realm of Bliss which is the Self.

This mind-quietening process cannot be achieved at one go.  \\nIt is clearly advised that mind should achieve quietitude as a result of withdrawal from \\nsense objects by degrees - slowly and slowly. \\n \\nThereafter, patiently, the mind should be made to contemplate on the Self with the aid of \\nthe intellect.

Through practice \\nof discrimination and detachment the mind gradually attains inner peace. \\n \\nThe Lord advises the seeker to bring back the mind that has gone out on a roaming \\nmission.  As soon as the mind is withdrawn through will power it will go out again \\nbecause mind means flow of thoughts and it can never be steady without any motion. \\nTherefore in the meditation when the mind is withdrawn from the sense objects it should \\nbe provided with an alternative to keep it busy. That alternative is its application towards \\ncontemplating on the Self alone. \\n \\nRESULT OF THE YOGA OF MEDITATION \\n \\nprashaantamanasam hyenam yoginam sukhamuttamam \\nupaiti shaantarajasam brahmabhootamakalmasham  // 6.27 // \\n \\nSupreme bliss verily comes to this yogi whose mind is completely tranquil, whose \\npassions are quietened, who is free from sin and has become one with Brahman. \\n \\nyunjannevam sadaa'tmaanam yogee vigatakalmashah \\nsukhena brahmasamsparsham atyantam sukham ashnute  // 6.28 // \\n \\nThe yogi always engaging the mind thus (in the practice of yoga) freed from sins easily \\nenjoys the Infinite Bliss of contact with Brahman. \\n \\nIn these two verses the Lord describes the benefits of Yoga.

Krishna begins with the definition of a \\nsannyasi, a renounced person. Renunciation is not giving up enjoyments, abandoning \\none’s duties and escaping to a safe sanctuary. It is this misunderstanding that has turned \\naway genuine seekers and prevented them from accessing the benefits of renunciation. \\nKrishna describes a sannyasi as one who does what one ought to do, fulfils one’s duties \\nand responsibilities fully, without depending on the fruit of action.  \\n \\nA sannyasi is not one without a higher ideal, nor is he an inactive person. Krishna \\ndescribes the three stages of spiritual evolution, from an active yogi to a meditative \\nsannyasi and, finally, to the exalted state of a jnani, the enlightened One.  \\n \\nA sannyasi has offloaded the bulk of his desires and is in contemplation of the higher. He \\nis fit for meditation and embarks on the path of deep reflection and focus on reality. A \\njnani has reached the exalted state of enlightenment. Krishna describes the three stages in \\nterms of mental states rather than external appearances.  \\n \\nStep by step, Krishna takes us through the preparatory disciplines as well as \\ndisqualifications for meditation. One must have a balanced contact with the world – \\nneither too much nor too little. Every activity must be carefully supervised by the \\nintellect so that no desire interrupts the subtle practice of meditation.  \\n \\nKrishna then gives the test of enlightenment.

Then if at all we use the word Creation, it only \\nrefers to the manifestation of something which was potentially, un-manifestly \\nexistent. So only that which is un-manifestly, potentially existent in dormant form can \\ncome to manifestation. \\n \\nMANIFEST VS UNMANIFEST \\n \\nWhat is meant by the words manifest and unmanifest? By the word unmanifest, we \\nmean Pramanam Agocharam. Unmanifest is that which is existent but is not available \\nfor perception or transaction like the butter in the milk. Butter is there in the milk, but \\nwe cannot see it in the milk. But we know that milk has butter. So what can we say \\nabout butter being existent or not? It is existent technically but for all practical \\npurposes, since it is neither available for perception nor available for transaction we \\nassume that butter is non-existent. But we know butter is there. \\n \\nWe can extend this analogy to everything in the creation. Nothing in the creation is \\nnon existent. It was existent in potential manner. Later it becomes manifest, which \\nmeans it is available for transaction. Our scriptures point out, before the origination of \\nthis cosmos, it should have existed because of this simple law of conservation. And if \\nthis creation existed before, it should have existed in un-differentiated and unmanifest \\nform or potential form or dormant form which we can call as the seed of the creation. \\nIn Sanskrit we use the word Bījam for this or Causal form of matter.  \\n \\n\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-7.pdf', 'file_path': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-7.pdf', 'page': 5, 'total_pages': 29, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': 'SRIMAD BHAGAVAD GITA ', 'author': 'Vijay', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Acrobat PDFMaker 7.0 for Word', 'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 7.0 (Windows)', 'creationDate': \"D:20110524123825+05'30'\", 'modDate': \"D:20110530111336+05'30'\", 'trapped': ''}, page_content='Matter in its causal form is the source of all forms of energy and all forms of matter. \\nThe causal matter is called Maya.

That is Atma which is \\nthe consciousness principle, the non-material spirit. It does not come under matter and \\ntherefore it does not come within time and space. This means that as consciousness is \\nbeyond time and space it has to be eternal which implies that before the creation, \\nconsciousness also existed. \\n \\nSo now we had arrived at two things that were existing before creation -  \\n¾ Principle 1: Consciousness which is called Atma which is unconditioned, un-\\ninfluenced, un-circumscribed by the time and space. \\n¾ Principle 2: Whole creation in causal matter form called Maya  \\n \\nTo put it in simple words, we can now conclude that Consciousness and Maya existed \\nin causal form before creation. \\n \\nIn the context of cosmology or creation, consciousness is given another name.

Mind is also a creation or manifestation.  Body is also a \\nmanifestation. But mind is a subtle manifestation not available for a physical vision \\nbecause it is not tangible. But the body is gross visible to the eye. \\n \\nSUBTLE AND GROSS ELEMENTS \\n \\nThe scriptures point out that first, out of the causal universe five subtle elements is \\nborn. These are called Pancha Bhuta.  These are 1.Akasa or space 2.Vayu or air \\n3.Agni or fire 4.Jalam or water 5.Bhumi or Prithvi: the earth. In the initial stages, they \\nare in subtle form, which means they are not available for our transaction. They are \\nnot even visible.  \\n \\nMāyā is defined as Tri Gunatmika i.e.endowed with threefold feature which is seen in \\nthe universe.

Same applies for Fire, Water and Earth. Therefore we have fifteen \\nitems.

These are the five ways in which a man, through his five sense \\norgans becomes aware of the prakriti or matter. Hence Hindu philosophers have \\ndivided matter into five elements. It is to be noted that mind or manas (the inner organ \\nthat creates doubt), intellect or buddhi (the inner organ that decides) and I-\\nConsciousness or Ego belong to the realm of prakriti or matter. \\n \\nThe entire Sūkshma Shariram is born out of Sattva Guna and Rajo Guna of the five \\nsubtle elements. Therefore we have seen Sukshma Bhuta Srushti and Sukshma Sharira \\nSrushti – in short the entire subtle universe.   \\n \\nSTAGE 3 –TAMO GUNA AS GENERATOR \\n \\nFrom the Tamasic portion of the subtle elements are born the gross elements. The \\ngross elements are formed through combination of tamasic portion of subtle elements \\nin which each of the subtle elements combines with the remaining four subtle \\nelements under a peculiar formula to produce a gross element. This process of \\ncombination is called panchikaranam.  \\n \\nThus the gross elements of ether, air, fire, water and earth are produced which we are \\nable to see with our eyes. The five subtle elements are therefore the causes for the five \\ngross elements. The scriptures point out that the Tamas components of the five \\nelements alone get grossified to become the five gross elements – Pancha Sthula \\nBhuta. \\n \\nThe scriptures say that until grossification, each element was isolated and pure. One \\nelement was not adulterated or mixed with others. But when grossification takes \\nplace, the Tamo Guna of these five elements gets intermixed.  This is just like eating a \\nsalad. Sukshma Prapancha is like eating grapes separately, bananas separately etc. \\nGrossification means eating all together.  Once we come to five grossified elements, \\neach element has got a mixture of all the five. So Earth has got five elements, space \\nhas got five elements. Same way for Air, Fire and Water. This process of “salad \\nmaking” is called Panchi Karanam or Grossification.  \\n \\nOnce the five gross elements are born, out of that the entire cosmos including all our \\nphysical bodies are created. This is called Sthula Srushti or Sthula  Abhivyakti. \\n \\nThus Maya is causal universe. And out of that comes subtle universe called Sukshma \\nAbhivyakti. And out of that comes gross universe which is called Sthula Abhivyakti. \\nThus the entire creation comes out. \\n \\nTherefore causal universe to subtle universe to Gross universe.

This is Vedic Cosmology”. (Adopted from Swami \\nParamarthananda’s Discourses on ‘ Tattva Bhodha’ ) \\n \\nLet us turn back to the Gita. \\n \\nOnce the individual understands the distinction between matter and spirit, he will \\nknow that the cause of all our sufferings is due to spirit identifying with matter.  \\nWhen spirit is detached from all its identifications, it rediscovers for itself its own \\nessential nature as Perfection and Bliss Absolute. The spirit identifying with matter or \\napara prakriti is called ego. This is also called super imposition on the Truth through \\nignorance.  It is apara prakriti which is the cause of the world and by which the ego \\nor Jiva gets bound. It is the ego that rediscovers itself to be nothing other than the \\nspirit or para prakriti that presides over the matter.  In order to make it clear Sri \\nKrishna tells that the matter-aspect is distinct from the spirit-aspect in each individual. \\n \\nThe five elements are represented by the sense-organs by which the individual lives \\nand gathers experiences in the world of sense objects as we have seen above. The \\nsense organs are the channels through which the world of stimuli reaches the mind. \\nThe impulses received in the mind are classified and systematized as knowledge by \\nthe intellect.  During all these assimilation the ego falsely identifies the body with the \\nSpirit and the sense of `I' or `My' is produced. \\n \\nSri Krishna says that the equipments referred to in Verse 4 are not all that the Self \\npossesses. The Self has, besides them, equipments of a higher nature which are Pure \\nConsciousness or Awareness i.e., para prakriti (Verse 5). It is this spiritual aspect in \\neverybody that makes it possible for the body, mind and intellect which are inert \\nmatters to function as if they are very cognizant and intelligent. \\n \\nThe spiritual factor is the entity with whose contact the body equipment works and \\nwithout which it becomes dull and insentient. Without this spiritual spark man will be \\nno more than a stone and he will not be able to experience the world outside or within \\nhim.  The world of objects, the world of feelings and the world of ideas that we \\nexperience constitute in their totality the Jagat or universe which is supported by the \\nprinciple of consciousness. \\n \\netadyoneeni bhootaani sarvaaneetyupadhaaraya \\naham kritsnasya jagatah prabhavah pralayastathaa // 7.6 // \\n\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-7.pdf', 'file_path': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-7.pdf', 'page': 9, 'total_pages': 29, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': 'SRIMAD BHAGAVAD GITA ', 'author': 'Vijay', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Acrobat PDFMaker 7.0 for Word', 'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 7.0 (Windows)', 'creationDate': \"D:20110524123825+05'30'\", 'modDate': \"D:20110530111336+05'30'\", 'trapped': ''}, page_content='Know these two - My higher and lower natures - form the womb of all beings. \\nTherefore, I am the origin and dissolution of the whole Universe. \\n \\nThe above mentioned higher and lower natures together cause the manifestation of the \\nworld of plurality.  If there is no matter, the latent dynamic energy of the Spirit will \\nnot have a field for its expression.  The matter by itself is dormant and it cannot \\nfunction unless the Spirit is there to activate it, to enliven it. An example of this \\nprinciple is electricity and the bulb.  The bulb is the inert matter and the electricity is \\nthe dynamic spirit. It is obvious that one is of no use without the other. When the \\nspirit functions through the five layers of the matter it finds a place to express itself. \\n \\nThe combination of the higher and lower natures (prakritis) is the womb of all beings \\ni.e., these two are the cause for the origin of all creatures or manifestation.  The lower \\nnature manifests itself as the material body and the higher nature as the enlivening \\nsoul, the experiencer. \\n \\nAt the time of evolution, names, forms and life arise from prakriti and at the time of \\ndissolution they go back into it. But prakriti, independent of the Lord (Consciousness \\nor Brahman or Spirit) cannot generate anything. Prakriti is the Lord’s instrument of \\ncreation, preservation and dissolution. Hence the Lord is the ultimate cause of the \\nUniverse; as we have seen under the topic “Creation” above Brahman (the Lord) + \\nMaya or Consciousness (Spirit) + Matter is the ultimate cause of the evolution and \\ndissolution of the Universe or Creation or Manifestation. \\n \\nThese ideas constitute the nucleus of the knowledge about Brahman, Maya, \\nManifestation or Creation all of which are dealt with elaborately in the subsequent \\nChapters of the Gita especially in Chapters 8, 9, 13, 14 and 15.

The universe is only an appearance superimposed by illusion (Maya) on \\nthe Lord. It is like a mirage in the desert. From the standpoint of the onlooker, the \\nillusory water exists in the desert; but the desert does not depend upon or exist in the \\nmirage. Likewise this universe, apparently superimposed on the Lord, exists in the \\nLord, but the Lord is not in the universe.

The gunas, on the contrary, are subject to \\nHim. \\n \\nGUNAS \\n \\nA reference to the gunas was made by Krishna in the Gita earlier vide Chapter 2 verse \\n45. In the beginning of this Chapter we have seen the Lord is of two kinds of nature \\nviz, Purusha and Prakriti. Thee former denotes the Soul or Consciousness and the \\nlatter Nature or matter, which is dull and insentient. Prakriti consists of three gunas \\nnamely, sattva, rajas, and tamas. Rajas denotes restlessness or active principle. Tamas \\nis the principle of inertia and Sattva, serenity and harmony, is the equilibrium between \\nrajas and tamas. As prakriti consists of the three gunas, every object in prakriti is \\ncompounded of these three gunas. Samsara is the realm of the gunas. Freedom is \\nbeyond these gunas. \\n \\nPrakriti is not independent of the Lord. Everything constituted by the three gunas is in \\nno sense a self-dependent essence independent of God but springs from Him alone. \\nWhile He contains and comprehends all, they do not contain and comprehend Him. \\nThis is the distinction between God and His creatures. They undergo changes because \\nof the divine but their changes do not touch the integrity of the Divine. The lord is not \\nsubject to any one else, while all things are subject to Him. \\n \\nMatter exists because of Spirit and Spirit is never restrained or regulated by the finite \\nmatter.  The three Gunas - Sattva, Rajas and Tamas - which are temperaments or \\nnature of the head and heart, by which the instruments of feeling, thinking and action \\ncome to play their role everywhere, rise from the Self.  \\n \\nMODES OF NATURE CONFUSE MEN \\n \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-7.pdf', 'file_path': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-7.pdf', 'page': 12, 'total_pages': 29, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': 'SRIMAD BHAGAVAD GITA ', 'author': 'Vijay', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Acrobat PDFMaker 7.0 for Word', 'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 7.0 (Windows)', 'creationDate': \"D:20110524123825+05'30'\", 'modDate': \"D:20110530111336+05'30'\", 'trapped': ''}, page_content=\"tribhirgunamayair bhaavairebhih sarvamidam jagat \\nmohitam naabhijaanaati maamebhyah paramavyayam // 7.13 // \\n \\nDeluded by these threefold Gunas (modes of nature) of Prakriti the whole world does \\nnot recognize Me as distinct from them and imperishable. \\n \\nThe people of this world are deluded by the three gunas or qualities of nature. \\nAffection, attachment and infatuated love, hatred are all the characteristics of the \\ngunas.

So long as a ghost is \\nseen in the post, the vision of the post will not be available to the perceiver. Thus \\ndeluded, the ego does not realize the Supreme as different from it.  \\n \\nDr.S.Radhakrishnan comments: “According to Sankara the Supreme expresses His \\nregret that the world does not know Him, the Supreme Lord who is, by nature, eternal, \\npure, enlightened and free, the Self of all beings, devoid of attributes (gunatheetha) by \\nknowing whom the seed of the evil of samsara is burnt up.

In this verse He gives the negative nature in those who \\ncannot overcome this delusion for realizing the Divinity in themselves. \\n \\nHe says that low men because of their delusion and indulgence in evil actions, follow \\nthe path of the devil (Asura) and get themselves deprived of their discrimination. The \\ndifference between man and animal is his rational intellect by which he can \\ndistinguish between the good and the evil, the high and the low, the moral and the \\nimmoral etc. This rational discriminative capacity alone helps the man to cast off his \\nimperfections and become aware of his essential nature of Absolute Divinity. \\n \\nThe evil doers cannot attain to the Supreme, for their mind and will are not \\ninstruments of the Spirit but of the ego.

We do not act \\nthen to gain any personal interest or avoid personal suffering but only as instrument of \\nthe Divine. \\n \\nConcepts and Issues \\n \\nThe Lord says that He is of two kinds of nature viz. Lower nature (Apara Prakriti) and \\nHigher Nature (Para Prakriti). The lower nature is divided eightfold. They are 1.earth \\n2.water 3.fire 4.air 5.space 6.mind 7.intellect and 8.egoism. The higher nature is the \\nfundamental factor, the substratum the very life-principle with which the entire \\nuniverse is sustained- The Atman, The Self, Consciousness. \\n  \\nThe lower nature is Matter and the higher is Spirit. The Universe has manifested from \\nthese two kinds of nature only.  The Lord says that in His higher nature He is the sole \\ncause and ultimate support of the entire creation.

Krishna tells him that \\nthere are also other forms of devotion which are at a lower level as they are performed \\nwith various motives.  \\n \\nFour kinds of virtuous people worship God. They are seekers of wealth, the \\ndistressed, seekers of knowledge, and jnani or the wise. The first three approach God \\nonly for gaining limited goals in the world. Distinct from these three types of \\nworshippers, the jnani stands out with his self-oblivious, non-utilitarian worship. He \\nhas no desires for any worldly reward. His worship is wholly directed to Self-\\nRealization, to reach Brahman. Krishna expresses His deep love and admiration for \\nthe Jnani. Whatever form the devotee worships, the ultimate goal is the Lord Himself. \\nThe Lord accepts such worship, knowing that it is directed to Him only.  \\n \\nThe deluded, having lost sight of the transcendental Reality, entertain a variety of \\ndesires in this world. They seek and earn the fruits of their desires. The Reality, \\npersonified as Lord Krishna (Vasudeva) functions in every being as Atman. Atman \\nenlivens all activities, be they material or spiritual. Hence Krishna says that He \\nsupports all actions of individuals pursuing their manifold desires.  \\n \\nSpeaking as Brahman, the pure Consciousness, Krishna declares that He knows the \\npast, present and future. Living Beings, deluded by the pairs of opposites which bind \\nthis world, do not recognize the underlying Reality. The wise, striving for liberation, \\nfree themselves from this delusion and reach the supreme Brahman.

They are virtuous because anyone seeking the \\nLord, whatever is his motive, is a fortunate and righteous soul. \\n1. The distressed - They pray for fighting against and gaining total relief from the \\ndistress that is troubling them. \\n2. The seekers of knowledge – They pray for understanding the knowledge of the \\nSelf or the knowledge of God. \\n3. The seeker of enjoyment- They pray for satisfying their desires and attain \\nenjoyment here and hereafter. \\n4. The Wise - They pray demanding nothing, expecting nothing. They carry with \\nthem as their offerings only themselves. They offer themselves in total \\nsurrender. Their only demand is that they should become one with The Lord. \\nTheir attitude is one of self-oblivious non-utilitarian worship of God for His \\nown sake. He is the one who has renounced all desires born of maya. \\n \\nIt is also to be noted that not all people belonging to the first three categories stated \\nabove worship the Lord; only those who are fortunate among them take refuge in Him \\nalthough they are desirous of rewards (phalakama). \\n \\nteshaam jnaanee nityayukta eka bhaktirvishishyate \\npriyo hi jnaanino'tyarthamaham sa cha mama priyah // 7.17 // \\n \\nOf them the wise man, ever in constant union with the Divine, whose devotion is \\nsingle minded, excels; for I am exceedingly dear to the wise and he is dear to Me. \\n \\nThe wise (Gnani) who with a single pointed mind surrenders himself to the Self with \\nan integrated devotion, which is not distracted by other compelling desires represents \\nthe Best. The unbroken aspirations of the Seeker to reach his own real nature of the \\nSelf are called single pointed devotion or steadfast mind - Ekabhakti. \\n \\nSingle pointedness of the mind is possible only when one withdraws oneself totally \\nfrom all other extrovert demands of the lower nature in him. In the case of a Gnani the \\nspirit is invoked not for acquisition of any sensual enjoyments but for elimination of \\nall the self-destructive desires.

It is the Self or the Principle of Consciousness which illumines the body, mind and \\nintellect. Its presence in each individual body is called Adhyatma, the individual soul. “At \\nthe command of this Imperishable, O Gargi, heaven and earth are held in their proper \\nplaces”. Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (III.viii.9). The Supreme Brahman alone exists in \\nevery individual body as the pratyagatman, the ego, the inmost Self and is known as the \\nAdhyatma. At the culmination of the spiritual discipline, the inmost Self is realized as \\none with Brahman. Though the Self is formless and subtle and therefore all pervading, its \\npower is felt by every living embodiment. The Self expressing through a given \\nembodiment, as though conditioned by it, is called the Adhyatma. \\n \\nAction (Karma):  \\n \\nAccording to the Vedas, the offering of oblations to the gods brings about the birth of all \\ncreatures; the oblations cause rain and the rain causes food, and food causes created \\nbeings.

'  \\n \\nIn these two verses Sri Krishna gives Arjuna exhaustive guidance that will help in \\nundertaking meditation by all. The meaning of the various terms used here is as follows. \\n \\nVerse - 9 \\n \\nOmniscient (Kavi) - Just as the sun is said to be seeing everything because it illuminates \\nall the objects of the world, so too is the Principle of Awareness without which no \\nknowledge whatsoever is possible. Thus, in terms of the limited knowledge we presently \\nexperience, the Self is considered as the Supreme Knower who knows everything i.e. \\nOmniscient and without whom no knowledge is ever possible. \\n \\nAncient (Puranam) - The Self is considered as the most ancient because the Eternal Truth \\nwhich was there before all creation remains the same always. \\n \\nThe ruler of the whole world (Anushaasitaaram) - It indicates that if the principle of \\nawareness were not present in our faculties of perception, feeling and comprehension, \\nharmonization of our physical, mental and intellectual experiences would not have been \\npossible to lead a meaningful existence. Hence the Knowing Principle or Consciousness \\nis the very essence of life just as without the mud the mud-pot cannot exist. The mud is \\nthe ruler in the world of mud pots so too is the Self the over-ruler of the Universe. \\n \\nMinuter than the Atom (Anoraneeyaam) - The smallest divisible particle of any element \\nmaintaining the properties of that element is called its atom. It indicates that the Self is \\nthe subtlest of the subtle. \\n \\nThe more a thing is subtle the more is its pervasiveness. Water is subtler than the ice and \\nhence water is said to be more pervasive than the ice and similarly steam is more \\npervasive than water. So also, the Self is the subtlest of the subtle which pervades all but \\nnothing pervades it. \\n \\nThe nourisher of all (Sarvasya Dhaataram) - Nourishment here means the support which \\nsustains everything. Just like the canvas supports ever so many different paintings of an \\nartist, the Consciousness illuminates constantly the ever changing things and happenings, \\naround and within us, from birth to death, through all situations which results in \\nhomogeneous oneness of life. \\n \\nOf inconceivable form (Achintyaroopam) - Various descriptions of the Self given above \\nshould not lead to the wrong conclusion that It can be thought about and understood as \\nany finite object or idea. We should be clear that the Infinite cannot be comprehended by \\nthe finite instruments of perception, feeling or understanding.  Although the Self is in the \\nform inconceivable, It is not inexperienceable since an individual can apprehend It to be \\nof his own real nature during the process of Divine awakening. \\n\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-8.pdf', 'file_path': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-8.pdf', 'page': 6, 'total_pages': 20, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': 'Microsoft Word - BG-CH-8', 'author': 'User', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Acrobat PDFMaker 7.0 for Word', 'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 7.0 (Windows)', 'creationDate': \"D:20110524181749+05'30'\", 'modDate': \"D:20110530111618+05'30'\", 'trapped': ''}, page_content=\" \\nEffulgent like the sun (Aadityavarnam) - So long as a man identifies himself with his \\nlimited auxiliaries in his body he lives in the external world of multiplicities wherein the \\nSelf is in-conceivable, inexperienceable and in-comprehensible. Once these auxiliaries \\nare crossed through a process of contemplation of the Self, he realizes his own nature of \\nPure Being. \\n \\nTo see the sun no other light is necessary or a dreamer cannot know the waker, because to \\nknow the waker the dreamer has to end his dream state and become the waker. So too, on \\nending the egocentric existence during spiritual awakening, one realizes that he is nothing \\nbut the Self at all times. \\n \\nBeyond all the darkness (Tamasah parastaat) - The sun is variable in nature like its \\nbrightness during the day with various degrees of intensity and its total absence during \\nthe night. It may be erroneously concluded that the Self is also variable in its intensity or \\nthere are times when It is totally absent. To remove this possible misunderstanding The \\nLord says that the Self is beyond darkness of ignorance. \\n \\nThus, the one who meditates upon the Self as omniscient, ancient, over-ruler, subtlest of \\nthe subtle, nourisher of all, of in-conceivable form, self illuminating as the sun and \\nbeyond all --- \\n \\nVerse - 10 \\n \\nAt the time of death (Prayaanakaale) - These words do not mean `the physical death' but \\nthey are to be understood as `at the moment of the death of the ego' when all \\nidentifications with the body, mind and intellect are consciously withdrawn during \\nmeditation.  \\n \\nEndowed with full devotion (Bhakti) - It means selfless love for the Divine without any \\nexpectation which implies identification of the ego with its real nature. The idea is that \\nthe meditation should be accompanied by the meditator's readiness to identify himself \\nwith the principle of awareness as earlier indicated. \\n \\nBy the power of Yoga (Yogabalena) - This is the inward strength that grows in the mind \\nof the meditator when he meditates upon the Supreme for long periods of time when the \\nmind is withdrawn from its agitations and the intellect rests on contemplation of the \\nAbsolute. When one is thus engaged in meditation, all his pranas get concentrated at the \\npoint of his concentration between the eyebrows which represents the seat of steady \\nthought. \\n \\nFixing the whole prana between the eyebrows - This is the process of controlling the \\nbreath. Life expressing itself at the various functions in a living body is called the Prana \\nwhich can be classified under five categories viz.

His \\nvasanas manifest at daybreak upon awakening. This cycle of dissolution and emanation \\ncontinues until the individual completely exhausts his vasanas, reaching the state of Self-\\nrealization. A similar phenomenon takes place at the macrocosmic level. The entire \\nmacrocosm manifests during the day of Lord Brahma (a God of Hindu Trinity as \\ndistinguished from Brahman, the Supreme Reality). Brahama’s celestial day consists of \\n4.32 billion terrestrial years. Similarly, the macrocosm folds back into the unmanifest \\nstate during the night of Lord Brahma, covering an equal period as his day. Beyond this \\nunmanifest lies the Supreme Unmanifest, Brahman. Humans reach Brahman through \\nspiritual disciplines culminating in single-pointed meditation.  \\n \\nThe Path of Sun, Uttarayana and the Path of Moon, Dakshinayana are discussed. The \\nPath of Sun takes a seeker to Brahmaloka, the heaven of Lord Brahma wherefrom he \\ngoes to the supreme Brahman. Whereas the Path of Moon takes the individual to pitrloka, \\nonly to enjoy heavenly pleasures and return to the cycle of birth and death in this world. \\nThe latter path provides only temporary pleasures of heaven for meritorious deeds done \\nhere. The former, however, takes the seeker to Brahman, through heaven because of \\nhaving mixed meritorious deeds with his spiritual practice.

The wise seek the \\nSelf while the ignorant, disregarding the Self, lead an empty life with vain hopes and \\nunfulfilled aspirations. They go through the endless cycle of birth and death. Confirming \\nthe truth behind the saying that whatever one strives for, be it material or spiritual, one \\nattains that particular goal, the ignorant gain their limited, mundane ends but never find \\naccomplishment in their lives, whereas, the wise pursue the ultimate goal of Realization \\nand find absolute peace and bliss in their own Self. Sri Krishna, therefore, advises Arjuna \\nto seek the Self, to subsume all worldly activities to the Self until Spiritual Enlightenment \\nis reached. \\n \\nKrishna begins the chapter by offering to impart the knowledge of Reality that pervades \\nthe world and also as to the means of achieving this supreme knowledge and thereby free \\noneself from all agitations and sorrows.  \\n \\nThe previous Chapter of the Gita dealt with liberation by stages through the process of \\nmeditation. But this way is not the only means of emancipation. A direct way is described \\nin this Chapter. This knowledge being unknown to the mankind at large, Krishna terms it \\nas a supreme secret and hence this Chapter is called ‘Yoga of Royal Knowledge and \\nRoyal Secret’. \\n \\nAll living beings and inert things arise from the supreme Reality, exist in the Reality and \\nultimately merge into the Reality. The periods of manifestation of the world and its \\ndissolution run into billions of years. The supreme Reality acts as the disinterested Self, \\nwitnessing the entire creation and dissolution. Those who fail to pursue this knowledge \\nremain bound to the world of mortality. Krishna, therefore, appeals to the seekers to free \\nthemselves from the manifest world and reach the unmanifest Reality and to discover the \\nDivinity that supports the pluralistic phenomenal existence. \\n \\nThe Text  \\n \\nSOVEREIGN MYSTERY \\n \\nsri bhagavaan uvaacha \\nidam tu te guhyatamam pravakshyaamyanasooyave \\njnaanam vijnaanasahitam yajjnaataa mokshyase’shubhaat  // 9.1 // \\n \\nSri Bhagavan said \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-9.pdf', 'file_path': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-9.pdf', 'page': 2, 'total_pages': 26, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': 'Microsoft Word - BG-CH-9', 'author': 'User', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Acrobat PDFMaker 7.0 for Word', 'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 7.0 (Windows)', 'creationDate': \"D:20110524183819+05'30'\", 'modDate': \"D:20110530111903+05'30'\", 'trapped': ''}, page_content=\"To you, O Arjuna, who do not criticize, I will propound this, the greatest mystery of \\nknowledge combined with realization, by understanding which you will bee released from \\nevil. \\n \\nIn this opening verse Sri Krishna assures Arjuna that He will reveal the theoretical \\nknowledge of the Self combined with Its intuitive perception. Such knowledge is the \\ndirect means of attaining liberation. This knowledge about the Self dwelling in the body, \\nand about the identity of the individual self and the Supreme Self, is considered most \\nprofound mystery because it has only to be realized through one's own experience or \\nspiritual intuition and cannot be expressed in any words.  \\n \\nArjuna is considered to be the most suitable candidate to know this deep mystery because \\nhe is free from jealousy and does not belong to the category of those who always find \\nfault with whatever others do or say.

This is just like saying that the ghost exists in the post but the post does \\nnot exist in the ghost. The post remains the source of the ghost. There can be no ghost \\nwithout the post, but the post can remain without the ghost.  \\n \\nA thing devoid of inner reality cannot exist or be an object of experience. The Lord is the \\ninner reality of everything. The reality of the Lord makes real everything in this world. \\nBut the reality of the Lord does not depend upon the world.

He \\ncannot be contained in any object. He is self-existent and self-luminous. Only a fraction \\nof His majesty illumines the sun, the moon and the universe. But He himself is \\ntranscendental. \\n \\nHaving said that, the Lord further declares in the Verse 5 that “All beings do not dwell in \\nMe; My spirit which is the support of all beings and the source of all things, does not \\ndwell in them”. On the face of it, this verse seems to contradict what was stated in the \\nprevious verse. Verse 4 admits the existence of beings in Brahman while Verse 5 denies \\nthe existence of beings in Brahman. A little critical analysis will remove this apparent \\nmismatch of ideas. \\n \\nApplying the same previous example of the post and the ghost to this verse, it is like the \\npost telling that ‘The ghost is not in me nor I am in the ghost. In fact, there never was a \\nghost. The ghost you perceive is only your imagination and not based on any fact or \\nreality. The only reality is I, the post. I was, I am and I will be (the post only). This is the \\nonly truth from my standpoint’. \\n \\nThus the contradiction between these two verses is reconciled if we understand that there \\nis no real existence of the universe and the beings. The existence of beings admitted in \\nVerse 4 has only an illusory appearance to the eyes of the deluded. Beings do not actually \\nexist, Brahman alone exists. Those who are fortunate to have wisdom clearly perceive \\nand experience this truth. They see Brahman alone supporting the illusory phenomenon \\nof this universe. \\n \\nWhile in dream state we do not see the connection between the dream world and our \\nmind.

Space holds them all \\nbut is touched by none. This illustrates the relationship between the Self and the Not-Self. \\nWhen the wind moves the space does not move. None of the qualities of the wind is the \\nquality of the space.

He can never be touched by anything happening in time \\nand space. As a light cannot be affected by the good or evil deed done with its help, so \\nthe soul, which in its essence is one with the Lord, cannot be affected by the good and \\nevil action of the body and mind. \\n \\nMAYA IS THE CAUSE FOR CREATION & DISSOLUTION \\n \\nsarvabhootaani kaunteya prakritim yaanti  maamikaam \\nkalpakshaye punastaani kalpaadau visrijaamyaham // 9.7 // \\n \\nO son of Kunti, all beings, go back to My nature at the end of a time-cycle (Kalpa); I \\nsend them forth again at the beginning of the next cycle. \\n \\n \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-9.pdf', 'file_path': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-9.pdf', 'page': 6, 'total_pages': 26, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': 'Microsoft Word - BG-CH-9', 'author': 'User', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Acrobat PDFMaker 7.0 for Word', 'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 7.0 (Windows)', 'creationDate': \"D:20110524183819+05'30'\", 'modDate': \"D:20110530111903+05'30'\", 'trapped': ''}, page_content='prakritim swaamavashtabhya visrijaami punah punah \\nbhootagraamamimam kritsnamavasham prakritervashaat // 9.8 // \\n \\nControlling My own nature, I again and again send forth all this multitude of beings, \\nhelpless under the sway of maya. \\n \\nIn these two verses Sri Krishna describes how His power of maya is instrumental in the \\nprocess of creation and dissolution of the universe. \\n \\nThe whole process of creation, preservation and dissolution is due to the Lord’s maya, \\nHis lower prakriti or nature consisting of the three gunas in their undifferentiated state \\nand yet He is unaffected by it. Vedanta while recognizing the fact of creation does not \\napprove of the act of creation. The Lord does not create the universe from nothing or \\nvoid, for nothing only can come out from nothing. Therefore Vedanta believes that the \\nLord, because of His power of lower nature, maya, projects out of Himself (manifests) all \\nthe names and forms at the time of creation. Consciousness or His higher nature endows \\nthem with life. \\n \\nAt the end of the time-cycle, the names and forms of the manifested universe go back \\ninto the seed state and remain merged in Prakriti. At this state the three gunas of Prakriti \\nremain in equilibrium. When this balance is disturbed, again creation takes place. This \\nprocess of creation and dissolution is without beginning.  Thus the better terms to \\nindicate creation and dissolution are manifestation or evolution and mergence or \\ninvolution. The Lord, in His pure essence, remains unaffected by the activities of His \\nmaya, though the insentient maya is activated because of its proximity to the Lord. \\n \\nVerse 8 says that the Lord, with the help of Prakriti manifests the universe. Because of \\nHis very proximity, insentient Nature acts. Maya or Prakriti is under His control. But Jiva \\nor the created being is under the control of maya. \\n \\nLiving beings come out of Prakriti which remains dormant at the end of the previous \\ncycle. Dissolution or the state in which the three gunas remain at perfect balance is called \\nthe sleep (dormant state) of Prakriti. \\n \\nThe beings at the end of the previous cycle merged in Prakriti are still under the influence \\nof maya or ignorance. As Prakriti becomes active at the beginning of the next cycle, the \\nbeings also assume appropriate births according to their past karma. \\n \\nSince the creation is falsely superimposed upon the Lord, what is perceived to be the \\nuniverse existing in time and space is, from the point of Reality, nothing but the Lord \\nHimself. Just as in the illusion of a rope appearing as a snake, the falsely perceived snake \\nis in reality nothing but the rope. \\n \\nIS THE LORD PARTIAL? \\n \\nna cha maam taani karmaani nibadhnanti dhananjaya \\nudaaseenavadaaseenamasaktam teshu karmasu // 9.9 // \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-9.pdf', 'file_path': 'Sample_documents\\\\BG-CH-9.pdf', 'page': 7, 'total_pages': 26, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': 'Microsoft Word - BG-CH-9', 'author': 'User', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'Acrobat PDFMaker 7.0 for Word', 'producer': 'Acrobat Distiller 7.0 (Windows)', 'creationDate': \"D:20110524183819+05'30'\", 'modDate': \"D:20110530111903+05'30'\", 'trapped': ''}, page_content='These acts do not bind Me, O Dhanajaya, for I remain unattached to them as one \\nunconcerned. \\n \\nBecause the Lord is responsible for the manifestation of heterogeneous beings of unequal \\nconditions, a question arises whether He is guilty of partiality as we normally think.

The Lord says that He is unconcerned about fruit of His action \\nrelating to the creation of unequal and diverse beings. \\n \\nIt is attachment to the fruit that binds. He is unconcerned because He is totally devoid of \\nthe feeling of “I do”. The creation belongs to the realm of maya and the Lord is beyond \\nmaya.

The magnet is indifferent although it makes \\nthe iron pieces move on account its proximity. \\n \\nSimilarly, The Lord remains indifferent although He makes the nature-Prakriti- create the \\nworld. He presides over the world which consists of moving and unmoving objects as a \\nwitness. By His presence the wheel of the manifested and unmanifested beings revolves \\nround and round. \\n \\nThe question why The Lord created the world when He is a mere witness is a mystic one. \\nWe cannot say that the purpose of creation is meant for the enjoyment of the Supreme; \\nfor the Supreme is devoid of desire and does not enjoy. It is pure consciousness, a mere \\nwitness. And there is no other enjoyer for there is no other consciousness; A question \\narises whether is creation intended to secure heaven for it is opposed to heaven. Thus the \\nquestion regarding the purpose of creation cannot be asked if one remembers that \\ncreation is maya or an illusion. \\n \\nIn Verses 7 to 10 The Lord defines His position through easy steps leading to a subtle \\nconcept which may appear contradictory. He begins by saying that He projects all beings \\nat the beginning of evolution; Prakriti is only an instrument in His hands. Next, He says, \\nHe is not affected by the act, since He sits by, as the one neutral, perfectly unattached. \\nLastly, He tells the final truth that He really does nothing, that it is Prakriti, activated by \\nHis proximity produces the universe. It is His light that lights up the Prakriti and makes it \\nlive and act. This is the only relation between the Lord and His Prakriti. \\n \\nThe important point for us to note in these Verses 7 to 10 is that Sri Krishna imparts the \\nsubtle knowledge that Brahman, being neutral, remains apart as a silent witness of all that \\nhappens in the phenomenal world of the animate and inanimate. \\n \\nDEVOTION TO THE SUPREME BRINGS ITS GREAT REWARDS \\n \\navajaananti maam moodhaah maanusheem tanumaashritam \\nparam bhaavamajaananto mama bhootamaheshwaram // 9.11 // \\n \\nUnaware of My higher nature as the Supreme Lord of all beings, fools disregard Me, \\nwhen I assume a human form. \\n \\nFrom time to time the Lord assumes a human form so that men may attain a godly nature. \\nIn that state the Lord acts outwardly like a human being though always remaining in full \\npossession of the knowledge that He is unattached to anything material and that He is the \\nvery Self of all beings.

But as per Vedanta the Samsara can be ended for the individual through sincere \\nmeditation. \\n \\nLife is a conflict between light and darkness. The former makes for release and the latter \\nfor rebirth. The Lord here uses the ancient belief to illustrate the great spiritual truth that \\nthose who are lost in the darkness of ignorance go by the path of the ancestors and are \\nsubject to rebirth and those who live in the day of illumination and walk on the path of \\nknowledge obtain release from rebirth. This attainment of liberation through Self-\\nKnowledge, while living in a physical body, is the goal of human life. The other courses, \\npaths etc. are described in order to spur men to strive for Self-Knowledge and for \\nattainment of liberation here on earth. \\n \\nnaite sruti paartha jaanan yogee muhyati kashchana \\ntasmaat sarveshu kaaleshu yogayukto bhavaarjuna //8.27 // \\n \\nO son of Prtha, no Yogi is deluded after knowing these paths. Therefore Arjuna, at all \\ntimes you be steadfast in Yoga. \\n \\nKnowing that one of the paths leads to Samsara and the other to Moksha, the Yogi takes \\nup the one leading to illumination and rejects the other. Here Yogi is the one who has \\nwithdrawn himself from his false-identifications and entered into contemplation of the \\nSelf with single-pointed mind. \\n \\nIn short, this entire Chapter is Krishna’s advice to Arjuna that he should, even while \\nacting in this world, strive constantly to be the one living in the awareness of the Divine, \\nthrough selfless identification with the Eternal, the Imperishable Purusha. The guiding \\nprinciple is that whatever work one undertakes, he should not lose sight of the Eternal. \\n \\nGLORY OF YOGA \\n \\nvedeshu yajneshu tapahsu chaiva \\ndaaneshu yat punyaphalam pradishtam \\natyeti tatsarvam idam viditwaa \\nyogee param sthaanamupaiti chaadyam // 8.28 // \\n \\nThe Yogi who knows this transcends all rewards laid down for the study of the Vedas, for \\nsacrifices, for austerities, for making charities; he reaches the supreme, Primal abode. \\nSri Krishna means a true Yogi - a sincere meditator - goes beyond whatever meritorious \\nresults are promised in the Scriptures from the study of Vedas, performance of yajnas,\", name='retrieve_bhagvad_gita', id='3180282e-3ea8-4577-aea5-b2db054e1b1f', tool_call_id='call_zr0m')]}\n",
